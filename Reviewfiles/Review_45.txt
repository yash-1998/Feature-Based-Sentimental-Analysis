I wanted to stay and live here forever
I have been reading the reviews here a long time and went to the resort with mixed feelings and lots of things, like my own face cloths, toilet paper, benadryl, motrin, lomotil, sunscreen, sunburn cream with aloe and lots of batteries and toothpaste.
We needed the lomotil at the end and the sunscreen and sunburn cream but the rest could have stayed home.
We loved everything.
The lomotil incident was my own fault.
We went to the Saona Island excursion and had lunch on the beach and ate the salad.
I think that is where we went wrong.
Hubby got sick the next day and I the following.
The resort is clean, the ocean is beautiful, the pools are wonderful.
All the workers are friendly, but a little Spanish helps!
I had my hair braided.
I wanted braids from the part in my hair down and wound up with corn rows.
Not bad, in fact, it looked cute.
But it wouldn't have happened had I remembered more of my high school Spanish.
The dinner at El Bucanero on the beach was the best!
We had two Carribean lobster, shrimp and conch in rice.
It was wonderful.
And romantic.
We upgraded and had everything we asked for instantly.
We had a problem with bugs but reported it and they sprayed EVERYTHING.
Can't ask for more than that.
There was low lighting in the room and I did take a humidity jar with scent from Bed, Bath and Beyond and it helped some with moisture.
Just go, relax and enjoy.
They serve you like you are a king (or queen) and they try to make it a pleasant vacation.
They succeeded for us, and we cannot wait to return to Ocean Blue.
Hola Senor, Hola Senora.
