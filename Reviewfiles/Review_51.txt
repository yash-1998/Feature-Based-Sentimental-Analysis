Satisfactory business hotel
I was in Mexico City for work for two nights, and I got a corporate rate through the organization I was working with (around US$90/night).
The hotel is in a convenient location as far as accessing public transportation.
My room was clean and given that I spent so little time in it, it was perfectly adequate while not being anything special.
I'm a fluent Spanish speaker and I used to live in DF, so I really didn't need to rely on hotel staff for anything, so I can't comment on service.
For the price I paid, I have no complaints.
