Needs Updating Arrived after late flight and walked into my room and my heart sank.
It was terrible!
Poky and small.
Bathroom was tiny with a dirty sink.
I had asked for a non smoking room and room smelt faintly of smoke.
Bed was nice although the smell of tabacco wafted up your nose as you were trying to sleep.
There was no room to put down my 3 suitcases.
We had to walk around them.
The balcony/lanai frightened me...
it was old and I wondered how much rust was being covered by the paint!
I might fall over if I lent on the bars!
I had a 2 room upgrade!
I wouldn't have liked to have stayed in my original room...
it would have been far worse experience than what I had.
I'd give it about a 3 or 4 out of 10!!
Looks nothing like the picture in brochures!!!
For value for money, the Royal Hawaiian, Moama Surf or Sheraton might be approx $100 per night dearer, but you are getting about $400 more in value.
Worth the extra money!!
