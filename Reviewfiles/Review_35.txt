Yup, It's a
Ritz (except the fitness center) Have stayed in Ritz/Four Seasons properties in several cities and this one followed in line; prompt service, individualized welcome card upon check-in (not that I need that kind of thing), clean, comfortable room and beds - and the requisite Ferraris, Porshes and Escalades parked front and center with the valet.
We had a ton of luggage including musical equipment, and the bellhops were attentive and luggage was in our room less than 10 mins after check-in.
Was a little disappointed in the fitness center - more along the lines of something you'd find at a Hyatt, but still decent.
Close to shops, etc.
Still ticks me off that the Ritz and other 4/5 star hotels charge an extra $10 for internet access, but guess most are just expensing it through on business accounts anyway, but just include it in the room rate - I can get free access at Best Westerns!!!
Overall, you'll definitely know it's a Ritz.
