Excellent Location-Very Good 3 Star
This is the perfect hotel for a stay in Florence.
Directly in the heart of the city on the main pedestrain only street this hotel is absolutely perfect unless you want to spend alot more money for something more elegant.
Anything else this price was on the outskirts.
To me in the city, its location thats most important.
The police assured me that to get to the hotel I could drive on the pedestrian only streets which were packed with what else, pedestrians, and so I did, slowly.
Drop the car at the hotel door and a driver comes to take it to the parking garage.
Very convenient.
A typical european good breakfast is included.
Some reviewers said the employees have an attitude, and perhaps they do, slightly, but I have found most city hotel employees to have an edge to them, and I am thankful for it.
They were professional, helpful when asked, and efficient at everything we requested.
Its a sophisticated classy city, enjoy it.
