3rd Visit in 18 months
Yes, the bathrooms smell - though I think it's less due to lack of cleanliness and more due to a lack of ventilation - and yes there's a bit of noise from the uncarpeted hallways and streets outside, but the location is unparalleled, and the price is unbeatable.
While you don't get amenities like room service or laundry, you do get a very helpful staff and all the bottled water you can drink.
And, for not too much more money, the suites are huge with nicer bathrooms - though they are in buildings separate from the main hotel.
I'll go back for a 4th trip.
The only thing I'd change would be giving out a set of earplugs with each room - we brought our own and it makes all the differnce in the world.
