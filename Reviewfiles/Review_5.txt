Extremely friendly place
We stayed in the two-bedroom villa at Ixora and found the place to be comfortable, perfectly maintained and relaxing.
The staff were as friendly as you'd find anywhere, and the German owner was always accommodating and friendly - giving us an itinerary and booking a driver for a day trip, as well as offering us a lift into town whenever we wanted.
Some people on tripadvisor have stated how the villas are 'out in the sticks', which seems a little churlish as transport is dirt cheap and you're really not far from anything.
If clubbing in Legian is your thing then, fair enough, this may not be what you're after - but if you're after a relaxing holiday where you can take in the island at your own pace, you could do much worse than stay here.
