Not Bad.
The hotel is in an ideal location, a few walking blocks from Bourbon St, just away enough from the action to have a good night's sleep.
The lobby is small yet welcoming, and staff was very friendly.
Bell hop went out of his way to have a taxi wait for us that was scheduled to take us back to the airport.
The room we had faced a brick wall, so there was no sunlight at all.
Unfortunately there were no other rooms available that weekend to upgrade to.
The room itself was very small but it suited our needs, which was basically to have a clean place to relax and to sleep.
I would probably stay in a nicer hotel next time, but for the price it was okay.
