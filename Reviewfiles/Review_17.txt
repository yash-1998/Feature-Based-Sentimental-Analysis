Small, expensive and pretentious
I guess I expected more for $450 per night.
What I got was a very small room, staff with a bit of an attitude and a double hold on my credit card amounting to twice the amount I paid for the three nights I was there.
I took nearly a week's worth of phone calls to get these erroneous hold removed from my account.
Stay at the Embassy Suites at Dupont Circle, you will have much more room, al ot less attitude all at less than half the cost of the Sofitel.
