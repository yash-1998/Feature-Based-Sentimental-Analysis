Declining standards Stayed at this hotel on 3 seperate occasions, and standards keep slipping.
First time:
Dec 24-26 2004Was very pleased with the sea-facing deluxe room with a balcony.
Room was small (but the rooms here all are), furniture was new, and the balcony was fantastic.
This was the time of the asian tsunami.
Hotel was still managed by the Meridien chain then, and standards were pretty good.
Second time: mid-2005Booked a room on the club floor, hoping to get a room similar to my last visit.
Pleasantly surprised when given a large corner room, racing the greenery with sitting area.
Breakfast and tea at the club lounge was good too, as was the italian restaurant on the roof La Cantina.
Gym was wonderful too.Vowed to return.
Third and last time: Dec 2005Booked a club room again.
Absolute disaster after hotel stopped being called Changi Meridien.
First, paid premium for club floor only to find out that the lounge was closed.
Second, breakfast at the coffeehouse at the lobby was horrid, having no seats as the place was full of screaming kids and families.
It made me wonder why i bothered to pay extra in the first place.
Third, cocktails at the lounge downstairs were a joke.
FInally, the room was just a standard room and I could see wear and tear.
When I complained to the manager at the end of my stay, he just shrugged his shoulders and told me to write in formally.
What nonsense.I will never stay there again.
