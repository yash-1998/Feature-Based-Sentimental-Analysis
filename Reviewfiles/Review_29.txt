One of Berlin's best value premium hotels
As a frequent traveller, I'm quite particular hotels.
So when I say that this is a great hotel, that means something.
In terms of tourism, it's well situated, only a 5 min walk from the Brandenburg Gate.
It's very well run and has a good fitness area.
Very good Feng Shui layout, contemporary but not elegant.
Great value for the money.
