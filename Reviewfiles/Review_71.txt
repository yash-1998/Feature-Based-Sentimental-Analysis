Royal Grove Rocks (or at least jams on
Tues nights) I visited the Royal Grove on 05/20-05/23; aside from the weather, which was generally overcast with some light drizzle, I had a great time during my stay in no small part due to the Royal Grove.
I arrived at the hotel and checked-in at around 3pm; my cousin, with whom I was sharing the room, arrived at around midnight (after his flight was delayed) and had no problems checking into the room after I informed Christy that he'd be arriving later.
The really cool part about the stay (aside from the great price and the proximity to the beach) is the jam session that took place on Tuesday night.
The owners (the Fongs) invited some of their friends over to jam to some Hawaiian tunes on some ukuleles, an acoustic guitar, an electric guitar, an electric bass guitar, and a set of drums.
The music was pretty sweet as was the impromptu hula session given by the (daughter-in-law?).
After the jam session, I had the chance to meet the Fongs, who as it turns out, have owned the Royal Grove for about 40 years now.
Although they still own the hotel, the Fongs leave the day-to-day management up to one of their sons, Tim, whom I also had the chance to meet.
I'm not sure how Tim does it, but the staff he works with was generally really friendly and helpful.
Speaking of which, Christy, one of the ladies behind the counter was a total rockstar of friendliness and helpfulness.
She wasn't alone in this; I was able to get directions to a good (and inexpensive) salon for a haircut, directions to a place for good eats nearby, etc. throughout my stay.
All in all, I had a blast during my stay at the Royal Grove and look forward to another stay there.
