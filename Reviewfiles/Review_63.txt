The best of both worlds!
I have now returned to this hotel twice for a week each time and LOVED it! For the price, you get a great deal of value.
The rooms are pristine, compact and offer everything that you need for a comfy stay.
The courtyards and pool were great!
the Staff are very friendly, talkative and open to any and all questions, As someone who had to park a large van, their secure exterior lot was so amazing.
If you are looking to be able to walk out of your hotel door and be in the heart of New Orleans, you are going to pay twice as much than the Maison St. Charles.
If you want easy access to local transportation and the Garden District, great local eateries (Slice is a slice of heaven!) and want to save your travel money to eat and shop-- stay here!
