Very Expensive for what it is Area:
Not great, quite a walk to Dam Square and Central Station (I wouldn't want to do it with cases).
This hotel is situated on a major (and noisy) roadParking: I was lead to believe it would be free...not so...you'll pay E25 per day...and I wasn't convinced about the security of my car at all.Customer Service: Friendly but not particularly helpful, equal to that of a (above average)hostel.
Breakfast: Actually, not bad at all, I enjoyed it (even though I did feel as though I waas sitting in a chinese resturant, very odd.Rooms: It seemed that they had crammed as many beds in each room as possible, I had 4 single beds in my room, I have no idea why, I was taveling alone.
I do have to comment on the sheets though, very comfortable...felt as soft as a baby's arse.
I slept very well.
Decor: Left a LOT to be desired, painting and carpeting was very shoddy and heavily used, it looked like the owner had got a couple of his mates to do the maintenance and they had taken him for a ride, this place seriously feels like a low budget motel, for a high star rated price.
I didn't dare us ethe shower for fear of contracting some nasty fungal growth, bathroom was unacceptably dirty (and the light didn't work)I wouldn't stay here again, there are much better and more professional places for the same price
