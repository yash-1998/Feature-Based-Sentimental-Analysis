satisfactory business hotel.i was in mexico city for work for two nights, and i got a corporate rate through the organization i was working with (around us$90/night) .the hotel is in a convenient location as far as accessing public transportation .my room was clean and given that i spent so little time in it, it was perfectly adequate while not being anything special .for the price i paid, i have no complaints .
