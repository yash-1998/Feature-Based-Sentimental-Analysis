perfect location we have just returned from a 5 night stay at the ritz carlton batt.we chose this hotel because of a special deal from british airways and the good location .it is right next to all the ferries and many hotel rooms have a magnificant view of the statue of liberty .it is also next to the city and all the skyscrapers, so the other hotel rooms also have an incredible view .you can easily walk to the wtc site, wall street, south seaport and there is an underground stop very closeby which gives you access to the rest of ny the area is very safe and it was great visiting 5th avenue and times square via underground, but it was also great getting away from the madness to the tranquility of the ritz carlton .you get a real chance to experience the real new york as most of the restaurants and bars are full of locals - not tourists .service in hotel very good and cocktail bar on 14th floor has outdoor spectacular views of statue liberty .
