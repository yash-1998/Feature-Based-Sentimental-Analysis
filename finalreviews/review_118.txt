i wanted to stay and live here forever.we loved everything .the resort is clean, the ocean is beautiful, the pools are wonderful .all the workers are friendly, but a little spanish helps .the dinner at el bucanero on the beach was the best .we had two carribean lobster, shrimp and conch in rice .it was wonderful .and romantic .we upgraded and had everything we asked for instantly .we had a problem with bugs but reported it and they sprayed everything .can't ask for more than that .there was low lighting in the room and i did take a humidity jar with scent from bed, bath and beyond and it helped some with moisture .they serve you like you are a king (or queen) and they try to make it a pleasant vacation .they succeeded for us, and we cannot wait to return to ocean blue .
