ok but not great.as per someone elses view the carpets were shabby shabby shabby, they had a scent .the top sheet on the beds are not changed when the room is relet  so it means we were induldging in someone elses sweat we had to request the change after noticing dried bits on the bedspread, however the sheets were changed everyday .the staff are nice and the breakfast was fine too .the hotel spacing was large and the bathroom was nice recently refurbished, this was the best feature .
