absolutely beautiful  .i dont know what people were complaining about, because we had absolutely no problems with anything there .we went to the steak house (la cava) and it was great .the presentation was awesome and you get large portion meals there .my husband and i both didnt much care for the italian food, however many others seemed to enjoy it .our favorite was the mexican restaurant, in fact we ended up going there twice during our stay  .the buffet was quite well   we really enjoyed the omlettes in the mornings  .there was a large variety of foods to choose from at the buffet and they all had good flavor i would highly recommend getting the vip package    its worth the few extra bucks .with this you recieve a very relaxing massasge, premium brand drinks, and lots of other little extras .our room service from our maids was great, but it also helps if you tip them .we have no complaints about our room at all   .it was amazing, large bathroom, and a sunk-in living room    it had everything we needed .we spent half of our stay sun-tanning on the beach, and never had trouble finding a hut or chairs to sit on   dont know what other guests were complaing that they couldnt find a place to sit by the beach .there we had to wake up a bit earlier to find chairs to sit on .the lobby bar is quite beautiful and relaxing .overall, my husband and i would definately recommend the resort though .it was absolutely gorgeous and the staff there was amazing .we did alot of walking along the beach everyday there, and thought that our resort had the best part of the beach by far   it was clean and had the most huts and chairs we would definately go back, and to those of you who are going you'll have a blast  .
