was blown away by hotel vitale.with all the great hotels in san francisco it is hard to believe that there was room for one more .we had views of the water and bay bridge from our hotel .without a doubt the best views in san francisco (and yes i have stayed at mandarin and park hyatt) .in addition to the great location and views the bed was without a doubt the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in .also, the room had cool amenities like electric shades, bose i-pod deck, dvd and flat screen tvs it is one of the joie de vivre (spelling?).properties so the price was nice $199 .the restaurant was yummy and the hotel is small enough that after 3 days we had a chance to get to know the staff .anyway i loved the hotel and am the first one to right a nasty review so i thought i would take the time to let others know that there is a good value and great hotel waiting for them at hotel vitale .
