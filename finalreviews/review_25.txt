we had views of the water and bay bridge from our hotel .without a doubt the best views in san francisco (and yes i have stayed at mandarin and park hyatt) .in addition to the great location and views the bed was without a doubt the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in .also, the room had cool amenities like electric shades, bose i-pod deck, dvd and flat screen tvs it is one of the joie de vivre (spelling?).properties so the price was nice $199 .the restaurant was yummy and the hotel is small enough that after 3 days we had a chance to get to know the staff .anyway i loved the hotel and am the first one to right a nasty review so i thought i would take the time to let others know that there is a good value and great hotel waiting for them at hotel vitale .
