good and questionable.that was ok since i assumed a double' meant two beds ( as indicated on their website) well, my room was located behind the elevators with a double bed .the bed was against the wall of the smallest room i have ever stayed in other than a hostel in my college days .i admit the room was clean and nice .but, small .the manager said this is their policy and did not feel they need to reduce my rates for my (small) room .the pro's: great workout facility and snack pantry .this hotel is in a great location for driving to most areas of phoenix .there is not very much in walking distance .
