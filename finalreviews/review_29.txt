one of berlin's best value premium hotels.so when i say that this is a great hotel, that means something .in terms of tourism, it's well situated, only a 5 min walk from the brandenburg gate .it's very well run and has a good fitness area .very good feng shui layout, contemporary but not elegant .great value for the money .
