great location stayed here for 2 days .the location is great, just off union square .however, the check-in person was quick, efficient and smiling, and gave us high floor with a view of union square .the room itself was fine without being grand .on another occasion, the reception was also able to change canadian dollars to us dollars quickly, although they warned me that their rate is higher .took the bart train from the airport to the hotel .while leaving, we walked to a car rental nearby and drove away to our next destination (san jose) .be prepared to pay for everything .internet access was $10 .there is a charge if you want to print something .didnt touch the minibar .however, they have automated machines to print out airline boarding passes (free) .checkout can be done through these machines as well .in summary, the grand hyatt is a good hotel with a great location .
