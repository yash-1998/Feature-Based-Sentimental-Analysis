it took us approximately an hour to finally get the room we had originally reserved and pre-paid for   when we should've originally had it when we walked through the door .what we did get at first was a standard (non-upgraded) 1 double (small/handicap) room .when we called for more towels and shampoo, i had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for .and when i called, the lady sounded bland and bothered .the towels finally came, but no shampoo (which came later) .ontop of all of this, no one offered us any sort of compensation or restitution for the mix-up or long wait  .
