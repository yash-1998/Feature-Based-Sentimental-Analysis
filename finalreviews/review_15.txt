a top choice in barcelona.i had spent two nights at the hotel 1898 on las ramblas before checking in to the cf, and although a night in a standard room at the cf was 110 euro a night more expensive than a superior room at the 1898, the cf truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money i should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the cf for the weekend of november 17th, but i ended up having to change my travel dates due to work .obviously, it would have been great to get the cheaper rate, but i would pay the higher rate again for a chance to stay at the casa fuster where the service and the accommodations are truly top notch .still, my second impression of the cf (the 1st being the absolutely stunning building exterior ?.with bellhops coming and going and groups congregating all over the lobby was ow this is a real hotel?.i would say that the cf and the 1898 are of similar size, but the lobby of the cf was much more lively than the 1898 although they both had high occupancy during my stay .of course, the first thing i noticed as i was walking back up pasaig de gracia towards the hotel was a large grey tour-bus parked outside the hotel .still, this lobby was crowded in the way i enjoy so i cannot fault it although i expected the standard room at the cf to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the cf had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the hotel de russie in rome .you could comfortably fit two people in this bathroom which i appreciated even though i was traveling alone .i did have a minor problem with the shower ?.thankfully when i returned to my room the attendants who had done turn-down service had replaced my wet towels with fresh ones .although the cf felt from the start like a real deluxe experience, it proved itself to be such on my very first night there .regretfully, there was a private event going on at the time and the gentleman at the front desk apologized and offered to have me served in the upstairs library-quite area which i happily accepted .when he returned her informed me that the glass of wine was n the house,?.which could not have made me happier .very unexpected and very, very nice .the later was on the pricey side but no more than i expected to pay at such a fine hotel .although i would stay at the 1898 again, if i budget was not a constraint i would choose the cf hands down .you pay more, but you get so much more .but i wouldn think twice about staying at the cf again .i cannot fault the experience ?.well maybe the 5 pound room key system really does need to be done away with in favor of a keycard ?.but otherwise it was truly wonderful .thankfully the cf was everything i expected ?.actually better b/c it surpassed the 1898 ?.truly a tough act to follow ?.i would say that the cf met my expectations in every way and exceeded them in certain ways as well .the 1898 may be a better value because it is much, much more affordably priced while offering many similar amenities and services .that of the cf is decidedly more up-market .the cf is amongst the best in barcelona .in the meantime, the casa fuster will be for me the best place to sty in barcelona .
