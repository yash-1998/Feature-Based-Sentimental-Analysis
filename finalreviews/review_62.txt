no problems with this place.the bus ride was fine and had ac but it takes about 45 mins to get to the resort .the check in was easy and it only took us about 20 min and we were in our room .the room was fine and our maid cleaned every day and left plenty of water and changed the sheets a couple of times during our stay .we had a problem with the safe and the back door would not locked when we first got in the room .we called the front desk and they had someone there with-in 10 min  and they fixed it .the food at the buffet was fine and they did change it up but you do get kind of tired of it by the end of the week .the pool was nice and we never had a problem finding a place to sit down .the beach was also nice and if you got down there by around 9:00 you could find a nice spot, any time after that you could get a seat but it would be in the back .they give you towel cards and you can get your towel at 8:00 .be careful though a couple had some travel papers stolen from a book on the beach .we had one problem where a woman sat in our seats one day and she thought that her husband had left the towels for her and went to eat .the drinks are fine and the water is clean to drink at the buffet's and dinners just not out of a sink or shower .they do have good alcohol and they would give you plenty of it in your drink .the bar's are not that far from the beach and are right next to the pool along with a ice cream stand .everything in the store you need to times the price listed by three to get it in us money .a candy bar was $1 50 and it is listed as 55 they had plenty of fun stuff to do bingo, volleyball, etc  and the workers are really nice and helpful .they really think a lot if you give them a tip and are greatful .the last thing about it and it was not the best part of the trip was the ride back to the airport the driver was going too fast and it scared us a little but he got us there .all in all this is a great place to go and you will have fun .
