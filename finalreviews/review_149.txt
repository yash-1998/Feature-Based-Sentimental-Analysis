i had a great experience .i was a little worried when i read some recent reviews of this hotel .i'm glad i chose to stay at the singel .the desk clerk joked that i had the smallest room in all of amsterdam and he was probably right but it suited my needs perfectly: a very clean, quiet room with all the amenities (shower, tv w/cable) .i requested a non-smoking room and the room was bright, modern, airy and smoke-free .the location is fabulous - near centraal station but on a quiet canal virtually in the city center but close to the western side of town with great shops and restaurants .breakfast at singel included an array of meats, cheeses, fruit, toasts, yogurt, granola, juice .each table gets a carafe of coffee/tea .friendly service - yes you leave your room key but this is common in europe  would i stay here again? yes  .
