us travelers beware potentially good.hotel, but us travelers - beware   .1) the majority of the staff doesn't speak english, so you'll end up getting the wrong drinks at the bars and the wrong food at the a la carte restaurants .drinks are bad anyway- either missing alcohol or have the wrong ingredients altogether .suggestion - order straight rum, you'll get more flavor .2) don't bother making reservations to japanese or french restaurants .their food sucks .but the steakhouse is worth trying  .however, their buffet (orchidea ?).is the best  3) also, if you plan to use included (non-motorized) water sports, you'll have to wait for your boat 2-3 days and deal with a very rude and arrogant staff of scuba caribe (contractors for bahia) .when we complained to the resort about this, guest services were unable to remediate the situation .4) room service is great, if you leave your tips at the beggining of the trip and if you are good at sign laguage .and bahia is mostly oriented at the europeans (who have min  .25 days of vacation throughout the year, and can afford hotel's screw-ups) .
