i definitley won't go back  .the beach was beautiful - the grounds were nice but other than that huge disappointment  the drinks were the worst i have ever had anywhere  the food was on the weak side as well, they couldn't of used any less quality anywhere .the rooms were dirty, terrible plumbing .in the future i'll pay for service and good food/drinks      when it sounds too cheap, it is .
