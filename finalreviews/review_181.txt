ritz (except the fitness center) have stayed in ritz/four seasons properties in several cities and this one followed in line; prompt service, individualized welcome card upon check-in (not that i need that kind of thing), clean, comfortable room and beds - and the requisite ferraris, porshes and escalades parked front and center with the valet .we had a ton of luggage including musical equipment, and the bellhops were attentive and luggage was in our room less than 10 mins after check-in .was a little disappointed in the fitness center - more along the lines of something you'd find at a hyatt, but still decent .close to shops, etc .still ticks me off that the ritz and other 4/5 star hotels charge an extra $10 for internet access, but guess most are just expensing it through on business accounts anyway, but just include it in the room rate - i can get free access at best westerns   .overall, you'll definitely know it's a ritz .
