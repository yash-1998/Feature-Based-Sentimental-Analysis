loved hotel zaza we found the best rate at hotels .com we booked a couple days before we left and only payed 118 00 per night which was for a deluxe parlor, which was very nice .the room had some high end shaving cream and aftershave lotion, dont use it unless u want to pay 30 dollars a bottle .the fridge was fully stocked with stuff to make mix drinks ,which we did not touch because it was way high and the goody basket on top of the fridge ,a bag of chips or candy bar 4 00 , we left it alone .our room had a retro yet classic feel .plasma flat screen with marble bathroom floors and counters, nice shower, candles lit in room when we came in and average comfy bed .the place was decorated beautifully and the concierge was very helpful .the dragonfly restraunt was very expensive but tasty and i even seen two famous people , if my eyes did not deceive me  i am pretty for sure it was them .i am a small town girl so the urge to ask for a pic ate at me, and they did not tell us when we check in and never having stayed at a place that nice, we did not know, but they charge us 20 a day for valet parking .we would go back only if we received a great price .
