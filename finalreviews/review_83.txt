great modern hotel away from the action in barcelona.great hotel for business conventions (part of the reason for my trip), but far from the life of the city .in a nutshell, the hotel amenities are fine, staff are friendly and very helpful, the restaurant is good and the rooms are comfortable .a spa/restaurant/pool on the 13th floor is very nice, although i got a bit tired of hollywood theme songs played at somewhat annoying volumes .all rooms have a view of either the ocean or the city .the only complaint i have is the location .the diagonal mar area around the hotel is one of barcelona's interventions (urban renewal project) .nearby is a shopping mall that is indistinuishable from malls anywhere around the world .taxi access is very good, located just outside the hotel .
