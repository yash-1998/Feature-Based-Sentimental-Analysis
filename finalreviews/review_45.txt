i wanted to stay and live here forever.we loved everything .the resort is clean, the ocean is beautiful, the pools are wonderful .all the workers are friendly, but a little spanish helps .the dinner at el bucanero on the beach was the best .we had two carribean lobster, shrimp and conch in rice .it was wonderful .and romantic .we had a problem with bugs but reported it and they sprayed everything .can't ask for more than that .they serve you like you are a king (or queen) and they try to make it a pleasant vacation .they succeeded for us, and we cannot wait to return to ocean blue .
