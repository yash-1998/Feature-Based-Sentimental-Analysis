nice stay for a very good price.the furniture and the decor at my room were old, (in contrast with the other that has new furniture), the mattress also was old, but still comfortable, i never had a bad sleep night .i didn't ask why but i had a bigger room than the one i booked, very spacious with two sofas and a table .the bathroom was very clean and in general everyone at the hotel were always friendly .the hotel is very good located, everything is light walk distance, you can also take the bart to the airport, which is very convenient .
