good stay and great views.this hotel was highly anticipated since we were booked in a king size balcony room on the top floor (27th floor)the views can't be beat, very nice to be able to see the golden gate all they way around to the bay bridge .hotel is located about 6 blocks from embracadero and about 1 25 miles to fisherman's wharf .located one block from pure chinatown experience .room was nicely appointed in room 2701 and the concierge lounge access is on the 26th floor .bathroom is a little small but the bed was very comfortable and the balcony with 2 chairs and a table were nice .only one minor hiccup but it was rectified very quickly and without mentioning .concierge and front desk and bellman were very friendly and outgoing .sedan and limo service is available from hotel from which we took a day trip to monterrey (2 hours away) for a day visit .
