declining standards stayed at this hotel on 3 seperate occasions, and standards keep slipping .absolute disaster after hotel stopped being called changi meridien .first, paid premium for club floor only to find out that the lounge was closed .second, breakfast at the coffeehouse at the lobby was horrid, having no seats as the place was full of screaming kids and families .third, cocktails at the lounge downstairs were a joke .finally, the room was just a standard room and i could see wear and tear .when i complained to the manager at the end of my stay, he just shrugged his shoulders and told me to write in formally .what nonsense i will never stay there again .
