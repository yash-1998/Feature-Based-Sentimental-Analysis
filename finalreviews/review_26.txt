should have been so much better.there were 3 adults but when we arrived they gave us a double room and told us that was all they had, even though they knew that 3 of us were coming .when we came back we had to rearrange the furniture to get around in the room .when i asked for a duvet i was told that they didn't have a spare one .we had to tell them about stains on the toilet wall twice before it was cleaned .they then both started to discuss the problem we had infront of us - but not in english .i thought that was very rude .i declined this because if she was unable to get us a room how were we supposed to?.we were treated like second class citizens .we have stayed in new york many,many times over the years and this was the most expensive hotel stay and the worst .
