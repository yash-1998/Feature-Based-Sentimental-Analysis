my new favourite hotel in paris .i chose it based on reviews on trip advisor, its location close to jardins de luxembourg (a beautiful spot in paris for a saturday morning stroll) and its convenience for getting to the airport (it is very close to the rer station luxembourg which is on the airport line) .the rates were very good on the hotel's website (summer special) .if you can get this hotel at a good price i would defintely recommend it .the rooms are a good size (for paris) - beuatifully decorated (completely over the top but very stylish and comfortable) .the rooms at the front overlook the pantheon - a little noisy on the friday night i stayed there but it didn't last too late and so sleeping wasn't a problem .2) was very good - a good selection of cold meats, cheese, bread, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, juice and tea/coffee .the staff were polite and helpful .i have a new favourite hotel in paris .
