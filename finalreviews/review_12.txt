best hotel in.wow .perfect location, very friendly staff, and very good rate for st patrick's day weekend .the room was bigger than my first apartment - i challenge you to find a room bigger than this for under $1,000 .new, sleek, modern comfortable furniture .an actual working fireplace in the room, but i don't know if they let guests use it .charming chair and reading lamp was just beautiful .the windows overlooked a playground and courtyard, and it was almost silent during our stay .we were right next to the elevator, and didn't hear a thing .big flat panel tv, plus dvd/vcr unit .the sitting area had a really comfy couch that i slept on w/o any problems (but i am only 5 feet /152cm tall), fridge in room so you can have your own food in there .the bathroom was huge - probably 8x11ft/ 2 4m x 16 7m?).and also had a window that you could open  .it was nice to get real fresh air in, not some noisy, useless fan the only drawback was that the complimentary breakfast ended at like 9am .it should go to 11 at least, but most us hotels end at 9 .anyway, i cannot say enough good things about this hotel .it was far better than the waldorf and sheraton in every way .
