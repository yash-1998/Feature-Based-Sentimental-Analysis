excellent traveling location.it is a good location in that it is near the shinjuku station, which is one of the major subway and jr line stops .the hotel seems a litle nicer than your standard hilton hotels in the us .service was great and we used the concierge service numerous times to find good restaurants around the area .it's a hit and miss with staff speaking english, although for the most part they understood us we only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was a japanese and western style buffet that was excellent .however, we skipped eating restaurants on the second floor as they were a bit pricey .if tokyo is the only city you're visiting i'd probably recommend a different hotel as shinjuku is a business district and pretty quiet at night unless you hang out at the station (the shuttle service ends around 9:30pm) .if tokyo is one of many cities on your agenda, i thought this was a great choice .
