satisfactory business hotel.the hotel is in a convenient location as far as accessing public transportation .my room was clean and given that i spent so little time in it, it was perfectly adequate while not being anything special .i'm a fluent spanish speaker and i used to live in df, so i really didn't need to rely on hotel staff for anything, so i can't comment on service .for the price i paid, i have no complaints .
