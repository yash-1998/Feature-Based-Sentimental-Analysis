extremely basic   .asked for a room near to reception which we did get but up a flight of extremely steep stairs .no offer of help with our bags from staff member who was too busy chatting on msn to concentrate on booking us in vending machines in reception, empty and don't work   .half the light bulbs didn't work, windows wouldn't shut .laminate floorboards kept moving .strange looking brown bugs everywhere in room .food disgusting .we were persuaded to eat in the restaurant downstairs the first night we were there, tasteless colourless small extortionately expensive portions .then go to breakfast that's an experience   .a table is laid out with ham and cheese, stale bread rolls and a large bowl of cereals .cooked breakfast is available as an extra .tea and coffee is available, but it is not offered, you have to seek it out for yourself .staff surly, refuse to serve you, had some waiter click his fingers at me to let me know my tea was ready .to top it all, we both came out in a rash that we assumed was an allergic reaction to something, it started on our wrists and spread over our bodies .imagine how mortified we were when consulted a doctor to discover that we had scabies    .the doctor said it could be caught from dirty beds or bedding .under no circumstances would we recommend this hotel to anybody .
