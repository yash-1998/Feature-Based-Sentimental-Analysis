just noisy the staff very helpful and friendly .the hotel was very very clean but the style of the rooms were old and tired (80), however the bed was comfortable and the bathrooms were nice and crean .it takes 20 to 30 minutes walking to la placa cataluna .very noisy if you are one of the front rooms cos of the thin glass big windows and because the main street but also noisy doors and you can hear other people and staff .i found balmes hotel expensive .
