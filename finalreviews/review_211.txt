once again, beat up and tired.hallways and room are best summed up as having the appearance of 30 years of spring break cavorting without a cleaning, stains on all walls, carpets, and furniture, typical dark w hallways and rooms, poor towels, overpriced water ($8 per bottle), staff with attitude at the front desk, car valets were very good, flies join you for your beakfast without invite, food stains all over the restaurant menus each time the last three stays, $3 25 surcharge for using the atm and limited to $100 (what will $100 buy you at a w hotel?),.well below expectation for a starwood hotel, do yourself a favour, bring lysol or stay somewhere else .instead of taking photos of guests in the elevators, they should video their cleaning staff to determine what they have been doing .the us disease control unit should be called into this overpriced dormitory .the bliss spa was excellent though .
