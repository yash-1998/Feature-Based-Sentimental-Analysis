the palazzo is truly palatial .we spent three delightful nights at the luxurious palazzo magnani feroni while visiting our son in florence .we never needed a car, since all the attractions of florence are just across the bridge within easy walking distance .the suites at the palazzo are huge, lavishly decorated with period artwork, and extremely comfortable .the staff are friendly, english-speaking, and very helpful in making restaurant and train reservations for us .a nice touch was the international herald tribune the we found hanging on our doorknob each morning .upstairs is a grand dining room where a sumptuous breakfast is served, and drinks are available there all evening .the 'piece de resistance' is the covered terrace on the roof with stunning views in all directions .we enjoyed it even in february, and in warmer weather drinks are served there during the evening hours .we recommend this magnificent hotel unequivocally to anyone seeking style, comfort, and luxury in the heart of florence .
