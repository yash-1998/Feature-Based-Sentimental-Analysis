do not recommend this hotel.the room was at the back of the hotel and did not get any natural light from the outside .the beds were so sunken that it was impossible to sleep on them .these are the worst beds that we have seen in any hotel of this rating .concierge presence was sporadic but the reception staff were quite helpful .the final bill contained some incorrect charges,so check your bills carefully .the hotel is overpriced .we will not stay there again even though it is in a good location .
