perfect  .the hotel seemed so big and more a business hotel (convention center just next door), but looking carefuly, a lot of families were staying there .staff is professionnal and smily (bellman, front desk housekeeping ) .very lighty lobby (nice atrium) wooden and natural materials everywhere .i had a very comfortable room with a great view of downtown boston, huge bathroom, and fabulous sleeping in heavenly beds, specific to westin   .also had a coffee maker with starbucks in room .there is a fitness center and a nice indoor pool, which is very appreciated when you walked in town the whole day  .so even if the westin is situated south of boston (as they said ),.
