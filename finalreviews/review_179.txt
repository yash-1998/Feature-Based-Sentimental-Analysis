happy choice stayed here for 5 nights in mid august with reward points .it was an unusual residence inn, looking more like an embassy suites internally, but the 2 bed suite we had was lovely, obviously newly renovated and really nicely furnished, plus great lcd tv's .the hotel is in a nice location looking over lake union, and not too far from the centre of seattle, (long walk or short drive) .the hotel is on a busy corner and road noise was sometimes very obvious but wouldn't put me off staying again .the breakfast area was very busy and seemed too small really to cope with the number of people grabbing their free grub .there was only one 'managers reception' rather than the usual mon-thurs .no matter, the suites were really comfortable and homey and we enjoyed our stay despite the small shortcomings .
