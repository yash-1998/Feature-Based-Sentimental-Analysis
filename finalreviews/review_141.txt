had a fabulous.holiday at iberostar punta cana this hotel had everything spot on .there was everything there that you could want .everything was taken care of and you didn't need to think of anything for yourself it was all in hand from the staff .service is fantastic in the buffet restaurant, your table is cleared immediately and your glass is never empty .some of the staff do not speak good english so it is worth learning some basic spanish .every kind of food you could wish for .rooms are really clean and spacious .good place for couples, families .
