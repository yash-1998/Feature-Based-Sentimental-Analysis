no problems with this place.the check in was easy and it only took us about 20 min and we were in our room .the room was fine and our maid cleaned every day and left plenty of water and changed the sheets a couple of times during our stay .we had a problem with the safe and the back door would not locked when we first got in the room .we called the front desk and they had someone there with-in 10 min  and they fixed it .the food at the buffet was fine and they did change it up but you do get kind of tired of it by the end of the week .the pool was nice and we never had a problem finding a place to sit down .the beach was also nice and if you got down there by around 9:00 you could find a nice spot, any time after that you could get a seat but it would be in the back .they do have good alcohol and they would give you plenty of it in your drink .all in all this is a great place to go and you will have fun .
