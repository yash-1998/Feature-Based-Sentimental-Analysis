stop  do not pass the reserve button  .we arrived on july 21, 2007 and stayed approximately 3 hours   just long enough to get booked and moved to another resort .none of the restaurants have air conditioning so you sweat your way through eating .not a very pleasant experience .our rooms were not cooled (both of them) and the sliding glass doors would not close all of the way which would allow the local mosquitos to eat us alive .the grounds were o k , but the atmosphere was that of locals staying at the lti .our first and probably last trip to punta cana .we are worldtravelers and there is a reason why there are inexpensive vacations to this island    good luck if you push the reserve button   .
