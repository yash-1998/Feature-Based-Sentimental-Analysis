nice hotel we stayed at langham.place for 3 nights over a weekend and were pleased we chose this hotel .all the staff were very friendly and were happy to assist in any way they could .the room was modern and clean with a fantastic powerfull shower, however we found the room to be on the small side as we expected a larger one for the ?.10 p/n incl breakfast we paid .we dined in ming court on our first night and had a great meal, we were surprised at how reasonable the food cost when i recieved the bill .the shopping mall next door has a good selection of shops, cafes and restaurants and you can go there from the hotel via an enclosed walkway .if you dont want to use the subway station at the hotel a taxi from hotel will cost hk$80 incl tip one way we did not use the hotel spa or pool but they looked great when i went to have a look around .the bar was busy and had some good live music and there was happy hour each evening between 18:30 20:30 where drinks were 2 for 1 free internet with 6 laptops was available at a location near the bar and a large flatscreen tv to keep you up to speed on world news and sport .the only problem we had during our stay was coming back to our room in late afternoon to find the room had not been cleaned .
