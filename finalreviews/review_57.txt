nice hotel we stayed at langham.place for 3 nights over a weekend and were pleased we chose this hotel .all the staff were very friendly and were happy to assist in any way they could .the room was modern and clean with a fantastic powerfull shower, however we found the room to be on the small side as we expected a larger one for the ?.the shopping mall next door has a good selection of shops, cafes and restaurants and you can go there from the hotel via an enclosed walkway .if you dont want to use the subway station at the hotel a taxi from hotel will cost hk$80 incl tip one way we did not use the hotel spa or pool but they looked great when i went to have a look around .the only problem we had during our stay was coming back to our room in late afternoon to find the room had not been cleaned .each morning we left the room at 09:30 and pressed a button to request room to be cleaned so it was dissapointing to find room not cleaned on our return i mentioned this a checkout and even filled out a form so i hope this problem will be sorted out we had a great time at langham place and would stay here again when i next visit hong kong .
