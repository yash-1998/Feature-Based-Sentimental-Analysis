the service was okay, its only once you got to know the staff you received better service .the room service was slow it take approximately 1 hour or so .restaurant:japanese- my husband and i loved the food .they serve you a variety of sushi .the food is cooked right in front of you .we really enjoyed it .mexican- this was our second favourite restaurant .the soup was good, we had the chicken tacos for appetizer .steak, fajitas fish with rice was really good .the dessert was good as well .steak/american- my husband enjoyed the steak, you can ask the waiter to look at the different cuts for the steak .i don't eat red meat this was a challenge for me, i ordered the chicken strips and it was horrible .if you dont eat steak don't bother going to this restaurant .french- we enjoyed this restaurant, we had sole and duck .the dessert was nothing spectacular .thalasa- i had the fish it was okay, the french was better .my husband had the lobster it was more like scampi .every other day at lunch there was buffet at thalasabuffet- the food is made in large quantity so its not flavorful .we did not enjoy the service and it was extremely crowded .crepe restaurant- this was good we went there everyday .we went to the disco twice, its okay nothing to rave about .show- the shows are repetitive so we stopped going after a few days .i would not recommend this for kids there is lots of booty shaking .amenties: my husband enjoyed the 9 hole golf .a few dollars go a long way for the staffhotel: the rooms are clean, just place the sign on the door to clean your room .overall: i dont think we will go back to this resort b/c of the language barrier and the fact that i dont eat red meat and i got sick of eating seafood all week .you are getting good value for the price of this resort .
