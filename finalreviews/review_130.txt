london cold and snooty.i was totally unimpressed .the bedroom was left dirty, we found discarded garbage next to our bed .we also found there was nowhere to store your luggage .we had a cold, boring room .no art on the walls, nothing .to be fair, i liked the bathroom .the front desk staff are inexperienced and not friendly .the bellman, concierge were all extremely helpful, and courteous .i love the location, but will think twice about staying at the london again .its too bad, because i have very fond memories of the rhiga, and i was hoping to have fond memories of the london .
