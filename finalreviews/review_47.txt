great hotel but don't bank on a good view all the time .we were in s f  in august (fog season) and could not see the street from 38 floors up    not to mention ever seeing the bay .if you have an expectation of having a great view just cause you are on floor 38-48    just be ware .otherwise, there are reasons this is regarded as one of the best in the world .
