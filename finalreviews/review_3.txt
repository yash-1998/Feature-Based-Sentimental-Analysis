i always try to book kimpton hotels.i've enjoyed staying at kimpton hotels over the years because of their boutique feel and welcoming atmosphere .i also appreciate the wine hours and the coffee in the lobby in the morning .i often eat in the attached restaurants which the chain makes an effort to create a destination restaurant .the hotel vintage park did not disappoint .the location is good and the front desk staff are very helpful .the room was comfortable and i appreciate the ability to get different pillows easily .having a bathrobe in the room is wonderful, especially for women traveling for business and trying to keep baggage light .housekeeping did a good job and the room was clean and fully stocked with amenities .the il tulio restaurant was also good for dinner .
