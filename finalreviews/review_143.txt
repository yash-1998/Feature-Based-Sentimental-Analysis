nice stay for a very good price.since my first stay at the boutiques hotels was very nice i decided that i will check all of them .the furniture and the decor at my room were old, (in contrast with the other that has new furniture), the mattress also was old, but still comfortable, i never had a bad sleep night .the hotel were still under renovations for the new look, if it looks now as they promised, it should be looking very modern .as soon as i registered i were informed that i was up-graded to another room .i didn't ask why but i had a bigger room than the one i booked, very spacious with two sofas and a table .i felt like i was at home .the bathroom was very clean and in general everyone at the hotel were always friendly .i always felt welcome .the hotel is very good located, everything is light walk distance, you can also take the bart to the airport, which is very convenient .i believe that you can considerer yourself fortunate if you find a decent and affordable hotel in the heart of san francisco .i forgot to take pictures, but i don't have complains .don't expect five stars, but expect a clean and comfortable room .
