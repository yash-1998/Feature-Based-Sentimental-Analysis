great location stayed here for 2 days .the location is great, just off union square .however, the check-in person was quick, efficient and smiling, and gave us high floor with a view of union square .the room itself was fine without being grand .on another occasion, the reception was also able to change canadian dollars to us dollars quickly, although they warned me that their rate is higher .be prepared to pay for everything .in summary, the grand hyatt is a good hotel with a great location .
