tues nights) i visited the royal grove on 05/20-05/23; aside from the weather, which was generally overcast with some light drizzle, i had a great time during my stay in no small part due to the royal grove .i arrived at the hotel and checked-in at around 3pm; my cousin, with whom i was sharing the room, arrived at around midnight (after his flight was delayed) and had no problems checking into the room after i informed christy that he'd be arriving later .the really cool part about the stay (aside from the great price and the proximity to the beach) is the jam session that took place on tuesday night .the music was pretty sweet as was the impromptu hula session given by the (daughter-in-law?) .i'm not sure how tim does it, but the staff he works with was generally really friendly and helpful .speaking of which, christy, one of the ladies behind the counter was a total rockstar of friendliness and helpfulness .all in all, i had a blast during my stay at the royal grove and look forward to another stay there .
