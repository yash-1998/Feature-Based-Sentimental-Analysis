not bad .the hotel is in an ideal location, a few walking blocks from bourbon st, just away enough from the action to have a good night's sleep .the lobby is small yet welcoming, and staff was very friendly .bell hop went out of his way to have a taxi wait for us that was scheduled to take us back to the airport .the room we had faced a brick wall, so there was no sunlight at all .the room itself was very small but it suited our needs, which was basically to have a clean place to relax and to sleep .i would probably stay in a nicer hotel next time, but for the price it was okay .
