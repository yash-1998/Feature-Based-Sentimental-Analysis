excellent location-very good 3 star.this is the perfect hotel for a stay in florence .directly in the heart of the city on the main pedestrain only street this hotel is absolutely perfect unless you want to spend alot more money for something more elegant .anything else this price was on the outskirts .very convenient .a typical european good breakfast is included .some reviewers said the employees have an attitude, and perhaps they do, slightly, but i have found most city hotel employees to have an edge to them, and i am thankful for it .they were professional, helpful when asked, and efficient at everything we requested .
