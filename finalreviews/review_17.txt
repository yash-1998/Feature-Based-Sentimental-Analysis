small, expensive and pretentious.i guess i expected more for $450 per night .what i got was a very small room, staff with a bit of an attitude and a double hold on my credit card amounting to twice the amount i paid for the three nights i was there .i took nearly a week's worth of phone calls to get these erroneous hold removed from my account .
