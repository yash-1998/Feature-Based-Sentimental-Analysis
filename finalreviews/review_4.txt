the hotel vintage park did not disappoint .the location is good and the front desk staff are very helpful .the room was comfortable and i appreciate the ability to get different pillows easily .having a bathrobe in the room is wonderful, especially for women traveling for business and trying to keep baggage light .housekeeping did a good job and the room was clean and fully stocked with amenities .the il tulio restaurant was also good for dinner .
