solid hotel this place is pretty swish, probably what you would expect .got a good w/e rate as place is in business district, so area is a bit dead but really well located to get to other areas easily and fast .good service, very nicely styled and clean room which was a good size .like most hotels of this calibre, the extras eg internet were an absolute rip off though .
