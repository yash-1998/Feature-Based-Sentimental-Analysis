we had made a prior reservation 5 days before-hand, and confirmed the day before that we had paid for and would stay in an upgraded 1 king room .it took us approximately an hour to finally get the room we had originally reserved and pre-paid for   when we should've originally had it when we walked through the door .what we did get at first was a standard (non-upgraded) 1 double (small/handicap) room .by this time, it was a friday night, we had traveled half the day, hungry, tired, and late for a party .we felt rushed, and it made both of us in a frustrated mood until the party (and even after, when thinking about it) .when we called for more towels and shampoo, i had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for .and when i called, the lady sounded bland and bothered .the towels finally came, but no shampoo (which came later) .ontop of all of this, no one offered us any sort of compensation or restitution for the mix-up or long wait  .
