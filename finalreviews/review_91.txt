good and questionable.upon check in i was given a double room .i reserved a king room but was told only a double was available ( same price) .that was ok since i assumed a double' meant two beds ( as indicated on their website) well, my room was located behind the elevators with a double bed .that is one double size bed just larger than a twin .the bed was against the wall of the smallest room i have ever stayed in other than a hostel in my college days .i admit the room was clean and nice .but, small .after checking in i looked at the hotels website and they still listed king, and king deluxe room available for the same night .as you can imagine i was not happy with the small room but accepted it .when i checked out i talked to the manager christine .she told me it was up to the the front desk clerk to assign me a room at their discrestion .since i was traveling alone they needed to give me a double to have a king available for other guests .the manager said this is their policy and did not feel they need to reduce my rates for my (small) room .the pro's: great workout facility and snack pantry .make sure you know what room you are given prior to leaving the front desk .this hotel is in a great location for driving to most areas of phoenix .there is not very much in walking distance .
