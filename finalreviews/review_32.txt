not bad, but not great either.the grounds were beautiul, and we had a great view from our room .the staff was very friendly and helpful .our sink started leaking on the second day, and when we came back that night it was fixed .the ac was not working at the time, but they did provide a large fan, and since we only spent our nights there, it got cool enough where it wasn't an issue .the restaurant service was very slow, however .on our first night there was a buffet, so we could start eating right away, and the food was wonderful .we ordered off of the menu and it took an extremely long time for our food to come, and the place was not busy at all .the food was good however, when it finally did arrive i believe on our next trip we will stay either on the north shore, or near waikiki, just to be closer to everything .overall, not a bad place, but a little too far from all the excitement .
