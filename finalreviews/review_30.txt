my husband and i spent a wonderful vacation from july 20th - july 28th .we have only great things to say about this resort .everyone is very friendly, helpful and always willing to put a smile on your face .the ride was a little bumpy but it's part of the whole adventure .anyhow, we arrived at secrets and were greeted with mimosa and a smooth check-in .we immediately had lunch in the mediteranian restaurant, great shrimp  .i highly recommend taking the pictures, i saw some of the couples fotos and were awesome  .overall the food was excellent, both my husband and i gained about 10 lbs with all the food and great drinks they served .benjamin one of the bar tenders is awsome   .he's always talking, laughing, cracking jokes and very humble .nicolas the front desk manager is very helpful and always willing to go out of his way to get what you need .we took bug spray but was taken out of our luggage at the airport, thank god the staff was spraying for the beach dinner or else we would have been eaten alive    highly recommend tipping, these people work very hard and don't get a good salary so tipping is good and makes you feel happy that you'll helping someone who is willing to do anything to make your stay at secrets a memorable one .
