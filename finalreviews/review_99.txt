should have been so much better.there were 3 adults but when we arrived they gave us a double room and told us that was all they had, even though they knew that 3 of us were coming .they arranged for a roll away bed to be put in the room while we went out to eat .when we came back we had to rearrange the furniture to get around in the room .the roll away bed had a sheet and a folded blanket on it .when i asked for a duvet i was told that they didn't have a spare one .we had to tell them about stains on the toilet wall twice before it was cleaned .we complained about the room at reception to a lady who spoke to us in english .a gentleman from reception was speaking to another guest in english .they then both started to discuss the problem we had infront of us - but not in english .i thought that was very rude .the lady then looked to see if she could move us to a sister hotel .she was not able to so then offered us a refund .i declined this because if she was unable to get us a room how were we supposed to?.we thought we were going to get 5 star luxury but we didn't .we were treated like second class citizens .we have stayed in new york many,many times over the years and this was the most expensive hotel stay and the worst .
