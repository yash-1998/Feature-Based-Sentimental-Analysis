poor arts has had its day.cracks are clearly appearing in the arts and it is in need of an overhaul i have stayed here a few times .one morning they effectively kicked my wife out of breakfast because they thought she was not from the club rooms .they don't need to be good on service as most people are not paying the bills and won't even appreciate the service anyway .even for business conferences it is a rip off- the amount they charge for basic business items is criminal .the design of the hotel, the rooms are holding up amazingly well, the food is very good, the conciege very good and the location is nice .( beware of the many pickpockets in the area)but the arts is neither trendy nor high rolling and there are many better hotels in barcelona nowadays .
