had a fun time  .hola my husband and i spent the wk mar 9th to the 16th at this hotel .we were treated great from the time we walked in the lobby,we had to wait for a room but it was well worth it  we got an upgrade because it was my husbands b-day while we were there and they knew this   we had a fun- vacation laughing alot at the entertainment group ,they are an asset to the hotel,black banana and leo kept the pool area and beach hopping and they were all good   we thought the food was good and the weather couldn't have been better .the evening shows(adult) were fun too   the pool and beach are wonderful,clean and only complaint was the saving of the shade huts,we had to do it too because the sun is intense .would go back but like new adventures everytime  oh get a massage it was heavenly .tip the maids etc they work really hard .gracias for a great wk     .
