good value My 10 year old daughter and
I had a 3 day stopover in Hollywood and stayed and the Orchid Suites.
I found the staff excellent, very helpful, you cannot get a better location for this money, and for the price, very clean and large rooms, complete with kitchens, so you can save on meal expenses.
The staff will book your tours, and Hollywood and Highland Shopping Complex is literally a stones through away.
Very safe part of Hollywood, and highly recommended for families.
The only downside is it is a bit noisey and not great views.
