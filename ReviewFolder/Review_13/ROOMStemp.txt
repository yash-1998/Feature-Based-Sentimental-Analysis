Needs Updating Arrived after late flight and walked into my room and my heart sank.
It was terrible!
Poky and small.
Bathroom was tiny with a dirty sink.
I had asked for a non smoking room and room smelt faintly of smoke.
Bed was nice although the smell of tabacco wafted up your nose as you were trying to sleep.
There was no room to put down my 3 suitcases.
The balcony/lanai frightened me...
it was old and I wondered how much rust was being covered by the paint!
I might fall over if I lent on the bars!
