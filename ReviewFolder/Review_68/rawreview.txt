Had a Fabulous
Holiday at Iberostar Punta Cana This hotel had everything spot on.
There was everything there that you could want.
Everything was taken care of and you didn't need to think of anything for yourself it was all in hand from the staff.
Service is fantastic in the buffet restaurant, your table is cleared immediately and your glass is never empty.
Some of the staff do not speak good english so it is worth learning some basic spanish.
If you are single girls travelling alone, you will get a lot of attention from the locals both at the hotel and outside.
They will all want to date you!
Every kind of food you could wish for.
Rooms are really clean and spacious.
Good place for couples, families.
Probably only singles If you are a girl !!
The majority of the people here are families and couples, so if you are a single female, be prepared to fight the men off!!
We met some really nice people when we were there so that helped make our holiday.
