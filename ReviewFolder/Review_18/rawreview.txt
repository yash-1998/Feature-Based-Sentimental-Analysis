Good and questionable
Upon check in I was given a Double room.
I reserved a King room but was told only a double was available ( Same price).
That was ok since I assumed a double' meant two beds ( as indicated on their website) Well, My room was located behind the elevators with a double bed.
That is one double size bed just larger than a twin.
the bed was against the wall of the SMALLEST room I have ever stayed in other than a hostel in my college days.
I admit the room was clean and nice.
But, SMALL.
After checking in I looked at the hotels website and they still listed King, and King Deluxe room available for the same night.
I travel every week and try new hotels in the areas I travel, To find a nice hotel with a good work environment.
As you can imagine I was not happy with the SMALL room but accepted it.
I needed to get work done and on to my Clients.
When I checked out I talked to the Manager Christine.
She told me it was up to the the front desk clerk to assign me a room at THEIR discrestion.
Since I was traveling alone they needed to give me a double to have a king available for other guests.
The Manager said this is their policy and did not feel they need to reduce my rates for my (small) room.
The Pro's: Great workout facility and snack pantry.
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT ROOM YOU ARE GIVEN PRIOR TO LEAVING THE FRONT DESK.
This hotel is in a great location for driving to most areas of Phoenix.
There is not very much in walking distance.
