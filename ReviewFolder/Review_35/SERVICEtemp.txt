Ritz (except the fitness center) Have stayed in Ritz/Four Seasons properties in several cities and this one followed in line; prompt service, individualized welcome card upon check-in (not that I need that kind of thing), clean, comfortable room and beds - and the requisite Ferraris, Porshes and Escalades parked front and center with the valet.
We had a ton of luggage including musical equipment, and the bellhops were attentive and luggage was in our room less than 10 mins after check-in.
