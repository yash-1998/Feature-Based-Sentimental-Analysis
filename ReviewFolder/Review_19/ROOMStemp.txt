Our room was absolutely appalling we had holes in our wall, plug sockets came away from the wall when they were used, holes and cigarette burns in the bedding, the fuse box had no cover (not exactly ideal if you have kids) my boyfriend had 2 open the wardrobe for me everytime I wanted something out of it as it came off its runners and would get jammed!
We had holes in our roof were at night we developed a skylight, the bath was full of chips and marks with limescale and dirt covering the plug hole and shower head, the toilet blatantly hadnt been cleaned for a long time and the only way to open the plug in the sink was by using scissors!
