The worst bit however had to be 'alcatraz' the buffet restaurant, were birds and flies freely roamed all over the food, this put us off so much that we booked into an a la carte everynight as we refused to eat the contaminated food!
However it was at the a la carte 'Roma' where we dined with another couple who we had met on holiday that, my boyfriend, myself and our friends all contracted food poisoning.
We were really ill my boyfriend shaking severely and we all had diarrhoea and vomiting.
This continued for the duration of the holiday and I have still not fully recovered almost a month after being at home!
