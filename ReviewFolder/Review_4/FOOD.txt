We went to the steak house (La Cava) and it was great!
The presentation was awesome and you get large portion meals there.
My husband and I both didnt much care for the Italian food, however many others seemed to enjoy it.
Our favorite was the Mexican restaurant, in fact we ended up going there twice during our stay!!
The buffet was quite well...we really enjoyed the omlettes in the mornings!!
There was a LARGE variety of foods to choose from at the buffet and they all had good flavor.I would HIGHLY recommend getting the VIP package....its worth the few extra bucks!
