Two things: firstly, Fisherman's Wharf is a really bad location to stay in, in San Francisco - none of the best restaurants are in the immediate area, and Fisherman's Wharf itself is a tacky tourist trap (even San Fran residents are embarassed about it).
In terms of location, the Holiday Inn is convenient for the boats to Alcatraz - but that's about it.
