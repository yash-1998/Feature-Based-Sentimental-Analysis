Awful - don't stay here!
Two things: firstly, Fisherman's Wharf is a really bad location to stay in, in San Francisco - none of the best restaurants are in the immediate area, and Fisherman's Wharf itself is a tacky tourist trap (even San Fran residents are embarassed about it).
Secondly, if you must stay here, the Holiday Inn is dire and should be avoided.
On arrival, we were given a room in the beach block (which is a 5 minute walk from reception and nowhere near the waterfront!).
The room was already occupied and someone's clothes were sill in the room.
On our second attempt, the room we were given was dark, gloomy, a little shabby and overlooked the carpark - albeit it had a large TV and clean bathroom.
The swimming pool is small and next to the main road - not worth booking the hotel for this perk.
When we checked out, it took a twenty minute wait as the reception staff were clearly overworked and underpaid.
Food: the main eating place in the Holiday Inn is a Denny's - a real crime to eat in this chain when there are so many excellent one-off places throughout the city (e.g. Mama's near Washington Square for brunch, Tomasso's in the North Beach for dinner).
There was nothing more depressing than walking past a load of overweight people shovelling processed meat into their mouths every morning.
I guess they couldn't be bothered to walk to the better places, as there are none in the immediate area.
In terms of location, the Holiday Inn is convenient for the boats to Alcatraz - but that's about it.
You are better off staying in the Nob Hill/Russian Hill area which is much closer to good restaurants, the Haight, Castro, Union Square, Golden Gate Park, the Ferry Building etc.
We also stayed in the Carlton Hotel during our vacation, and this was excellent value - nicely decorated room, friendly and efficient staff, convenient location - and most importantly - no Denny's!
