All the staff were very friendly and were happy to assist in any way they could.
The only problem we had during our stay was coming back to our room in late afternoon to find the room had not been cleaned.
Each morning we left the room at 09:30 and pressed a button to request room to be cleaned so it was dissapointing to find room not cleaned on our return.I mentioned this a checkout and even filled out a form so I hope this problem will be sorted out.We had a great time at Langham Place and would stay here again when I next visit Hong Kong.
