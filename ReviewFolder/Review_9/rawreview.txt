Loved it!!
My boyfriend and
I stayed at this hotel from Nov 25 to Dec 2.
I was a bit concerned staying at this property because I had heard a few bad things about this resort, but honestly this hotel is the best hotel I've ever stayed in Punta Cana.
Check in was quick, the grounds are huge, and very clean.
The rooms are huge.
You have 6 restaurants to choose from to go eat, you don't need reservations, but keep in mind that at the a la carte restaurants guys can't wear shorts( dress code in full effect) the food was amazing and I'm a picky eater!
Drinks let's see; they pretty much make anything you ask them too.
The beach is huge and very clean, there are plenty of chairs so you don't have to wake up early morning so you can get a chair.
Staff are very friendly.
The shows at night are very nice especially Chicago and the Lion King!
Please put some bug repelant at night there are some mosquitos at night!
There's not really much to stay about this property except that I had an amazing time and that this hotel and the service provided here is amazing, will i recommend this hotel to my friends and will I stay here again; most definately.
