I always try to book Kimpton Hotels
I've enjoyed staying at Kimpton hotels over the years because of their boutique feel and welcoming atmosphere.
I also appreciate the wine hours and the coffee in the lobby in the morning.
I often eat in the attached restaurants which the chain makes an effort to create a destination restaurant.
The Hotel Vintage Park did not disappoint.
The location is good and the front desk staff are very helpful.
The room was comfortable and I appreciate the ability to get different pillows easily.
Having a bathrobe in the room is wonderful, especially for women traveling for business and trying to keep baggage light.
Housekeeping did a good job and the room was clean and fully stocked with amenities.
The Il Tulio Restaurant was also good for dinner.
