Very good hotel in a great location
My wife and I stayed at the Dia-Ichi Hotel Tokyo during the last week of July 2006.
I would just like to echo what some of the other reviewers have mentioned, particularly the quality of the hotel and its great location.
The Dai-Ichi Hotel Tokyo is across the street from the Shimbashi train station (there is actually an underground connection), which in addition to a couple of subway lines also has the Yamanote JR train line which is great for getting to the various sights (the Yamanote line is a circle line that runs around central Tokyo and is covered by the JR rail pass).
This means that if you are coming in from Narita airport all your have to do is take the Narita Express to Tokyo Station and then get on the Yamanote line and travel two stops to Shimbashi.
In addition to great transportation, there are also numerous restaurants and coffee shops in the surrounding streets, including a full supermarket in the Shimbashi station.
As has also been mentioned, the hotel is only a 15 minute walk to the fish market which is very handy as the action there starts before the subway begin operation in the morning.
The hotel itself was very nice; equivalent to a 4-star business hotel in North America with well appointed and relatively spacious rooms.
The staff were very helpful and there always seemed to be at least one staff member available at all time who spoke English.
We got a very good price for this hotel on Expedia (CAD$160/night) - a price/quality combination that we would be hard pressed to match in any North American hotel.
The only word of caution would be directed towards very light sleepers as the hotel is next to the train tracks and at times some noise can filter through to the room.
