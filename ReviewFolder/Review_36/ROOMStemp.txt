This hotel was highly anticipated since we were booked in a King Size Balcony Room on the Top Floor (27th floor)The views can't be beat, very nice to be able to see the Golden Gate all they way around to the Bay Bridge.
Room was nicely appointed in Room 2701 and the Concierge Lounge access is on the 26th floor.
Bathroom is a little small but the bed was very comfortable and the balcony with 2 chairs and a table were nice.
