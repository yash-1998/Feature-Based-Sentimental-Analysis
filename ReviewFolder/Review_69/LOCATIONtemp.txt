Perfect Location We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton Batt
We chose this hotel because of a special deal from British Airways and the good location.
It is right next to all the ferries and many hotel rooms have a magnificant view of the Statue of Liberty.
You can easily walk to the WTC site, Wall street, South Seaport and there is an underground stop very closeby which gives you access to the rest of NY.The area is very safe and it was great visiting 5th Avenue and Times square via underground, but it was also great getting away from the madness to the tranquility of the Ritz Carlton.
