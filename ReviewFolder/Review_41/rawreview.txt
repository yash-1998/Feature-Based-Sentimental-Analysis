Awesome Location Definately recommend this place.
I stayed here and had a great time.
The location was unbeatable, short ferry trip to the city and fantastic walks close by.
The room met our needs and the breakfast was a great inclusion.
I will definately stay here again, next time I will try the King Spa suite.
