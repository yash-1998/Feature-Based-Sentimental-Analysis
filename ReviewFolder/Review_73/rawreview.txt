Great location and a really great indoor pool The Grand
Hyatt is the most conveniently located of the 5-star hotels in Beijing.
It is a 10-minute taxi ride from Tiananmen Square, a 10-minute walk from Wangfujing (Beijing's main pedestrian shopping street), and right next door to Oriental Plaza, Beijing's largest indoor shopping mall.
The hotels rooms are nice, but not exceptional.
They were clean and modern, and had good large bathrooms.
What makes the hotel special are it common areas, especially its large indoor swimming pool, which is one of the best in the world (we are not kidding!).
The pool area is decorated like a tropical paradise, with simulated twinkling stars overhead.
Adjacent to the pool is a spa and health club complex.
The hotel's lobby is full of marble and has a pleasant seating area where you can enjoy a drink or snack.
The front desk is friendly and efficient, and there is a helpful concierge desk.
Enough staff members spoke English that we had no language problems.
In addition, the hotel has a large full-service business center, which was user-friendly.
There are a number of good restaurants in the hotel, although they are not cheap.
If you want something more casual, there is a wide range of restaurants in the Oriental Plaza mall next door.
The breakfast buffet at the Hyatt was excellent, with a good selection of hot and cold Asian and Western foods.
Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt and definitely recommend it.
