Great location and a really great indoor pool The Grand
Hyatt is the most conveniently located of the 5-star hotels in Beijing.
It is a 10-minute taxi ride from Tiananmen Square, a 10-minute walk from Wangfujing (Beijing's main pedestrian shopping street), and right next door to Oriental Plaza, Beijing's largest indoor shopping mall.
