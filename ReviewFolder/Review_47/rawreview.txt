The Fog can block your view!
Great hotel but don't bank on a good view all the time.
We were in S.F. in August (Fog Season) and could not see the street from 38 floors up... not to mention ever seeing the bay.
If you have an expectation of having a great view just cause you are on floor 38-48... just be ware.
Otherwise, there are reasons this is regarded as one of the best in the world!
Good look
