Poor Arts has had its day
Cracks are clearly appearing in the Arts and it is in need of an overhaul.I have stayed here a few times.
Last time in January with my wife and this time on business.
In Jan we went for it and booked an expensive Club Room for a romantic weekend.
This gives you access to the Club floor with breakfast and drinks thrown in.
Or should do.
One morning they effectively kicked my wife out of breakfast because they thought she was not from the club rooms.
Despite apologies and rose petals on our bed we decided not to go back.
However, I have just been again for a business conference.
And that is what the Arts is all about - business conferences.
They don't need to be good on service as most people are not paying the bills and won't even appreciate the service anyway.
Everyone gets drunk in the bar until 3am and the hotel makes money.
Even for business conferences it is a rip off- the amount they charge for basic business items is criminal.
In fairness some things don't change.
The design of the hotel, the rooms are holding up amazingly well, the food is very good, the conciege very good and the location is nice.
( beware of the many pickpockets in the area)But the arts is neither trendy nor high rolling and there are many better hotels in Barcelona nowadays.
