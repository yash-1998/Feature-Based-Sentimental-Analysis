One morning they effectively kicked my wife out of breakfast because they thought she was not from the club rooms.
They don't need to be good on service as most people are not paying the bills and won't even appreciate the service anyway.
The design of the hotel, the rooms are holding up amazingly well, the food is very good, the conciege very good and the location is nice.
