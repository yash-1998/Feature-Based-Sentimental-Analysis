Worst place to stay in Barcelona
Ive been to Barcelona many times, usually stay in the city center but this time I decided to try this newly builded Hotel.
Big mistake.
Altought the Hotel is nice, the staff is higly unattentive and unpolite.
Specially front house staff which were extremly unhelpful.
Breakfeast was not good either.
I dont know haw can they claim to be a four star hotel.
The other good point is that no one in the city knows where this Hotel is, therefore if you want to take a taxi there you have to give directions.
I wouldnt recommend this place at all.
