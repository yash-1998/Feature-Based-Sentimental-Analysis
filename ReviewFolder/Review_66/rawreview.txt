London cold and snooty
I just returned from NYC, one of my favorite places.
I booked a stay at the London because I was curious about the changes they made from the former Rhiga Royale.
I was totally unimpressed.
The bedroom was left dirty, we found discarded garbage next to our bed.
We also found there was nowhere to store your luggage.
What happened to closet space?
We had a cold, boring room.
No art on the walls, nothing.
To be fair, I liked the bathroom.
However, there could be better planning on where do you hang your towel's when you are in the shower?
Our towels were behind the toilet, not within reach of the walk in shower.
The front desk staff are inexperienced and not friendly.
The bellman, concierge were all extremely helpful, and courteous.
I love the location, but will think twice about staying at the London again.
Its too bad, because I have very fond memories of the Rhiga, and I was hoping to have fond memories of the London.
