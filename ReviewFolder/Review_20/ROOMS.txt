Breakfast: Actually, not bad at all, I enjoyed it (even though I did feel as though I waas sitting in a chinese resturant, very odd.Rooms: It seemed that they had crammed as many beds in each room as possible, I had 4 single beds in my room, I have no idea why, I was taveling alone.
I do have to comment on the sheets though, very comfortable...felt as soft as a baby's arse.
I slept very well.
