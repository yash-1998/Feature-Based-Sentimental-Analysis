Restaurant:Japanese- My husband and I loved the food.
They serve you a variety of sushi.
The food is cooked right in front of you.
We really enjoyed it!
Mexican- This was our second favourite restaurant.
The soup was good, we had the chicken tacos for appetizer.
We went to this restaurant twice.
The dessert was good as well.
This is the only place on the resort they have Corona beer.
Steak/American- My husband enjoyed the steak, you can ask the waiter to look at the different cuts for the steak.
I don't eat Red Meat this was a challenge for me, I ordered the Chicken Strips and it was horrible.
Only place on the resort they have Budweiser beer.
French- We enjoyed this restaurant, we had sole and duck.
The dessert was nothing spectacular.
Thalasa- I had the fish it was okay, the French was better.
If you stay on the Royal side you can have breakfast/lunch here everyday.
Crepe Restaurant- This was good we went there everyday.
