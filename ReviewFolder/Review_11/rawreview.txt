Excellent Traveling Location
We booked our trip to Japan through a Japanese travel agency and this hotel was part of the package deal.
It is a good location in that it is near the Shinjuku station, which is one of the major subway and JR line stops.
There is also a free shuttle to and from the station, which helped (though the walk isn't bad).
The hotel seems a litle nicer than your standard Hilton hotels in the US.
We stayed here twice - a few days when we arrived and then a few days before we headed home.
Service was great and we used the concierge service numerous times to find good restaurants around the area.
It's a hit and miss with staff speaking English, although for the most part they understood us.We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was a Japanese and Western style buffet that was excellent.
However, we skipped eating restaurants on the second floor as they were a bit pricey.
If Tokyo is the only city you're visiting I'd probably recommend a different hotel as Shinjuku is a business district and pretty quiet at night unless you hang out at the station (the shuttle service ends around 9:30PM).
If Tokyo is one of many cities on your agenda, I thought this was a great choice.
Only downside is the JR to Kyoto/Osaka leaves from Tokyo station, so you have to change stations if you venture west.
I strongly recomend getting the JR pass if you do so.
