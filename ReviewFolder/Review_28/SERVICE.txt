It took us approximately an hour to FINALLY get the room we had originally reserved and pre-paid for...when we should've originally had it when we walked through the door.
When we called for more towels and shampoo, I had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for!
And when I called, the lady sounded bland and bothered.
Ontop of all of this, NO ONE offered us any sort of compensation or restitution for the mix-up or long wait!!
