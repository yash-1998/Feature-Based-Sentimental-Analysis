No offer of help with our bags from staff member who was too busy chatting on MSN to concentrate on booking us in.Vending machines in reception, empty and don't work!!!
Tea and coffee is available, but it is not offered, you have to seek it out for yourself.
Staff surly, refuse to serve you, had some waiter click his fingers at me to let me know my tea was ready.
