Save your money
We just got back this past weekend and for the first time I have never been so happy to be home from vacation.
The beach vendors spoke better english than the hotel employees.
The two semesters of Spanish I took in college only got me so far.
Had my boyfriend not been multi-lingual we would have had a real problem.
When we asked for an iron, we were told they were all broken.
One of the pipes broke and the whole outside of our bloque smelled like raw sewage for days.
I lost count as to how many times we were without water and the night before we left, the hot water shut off in the middle of my shower.
The bufftet was average.
The meat looked a little suspicious but the rest of it was ok.
The service was absolutely awful.
I live in NY and have gone to both upscale restaurants as well as holes in the wall and have never seen such poor service.
Most of the wait-staff was very pleasant, or so I assumed because I could not understand what they were saying.
I think that they were just so understaffed that they did their best.
The pools and beach were beautiful, the grounds well maintained, just lovely to look at but not someplace I would ever return to.
