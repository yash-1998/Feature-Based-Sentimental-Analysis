The beach vendors spoke better english than the hotel employees.
Had my boyfriend not been multi-lingual we would have had a real problem.
When we asked for an iron, we were told they were all broken.
The service was absolutely awful.
I live in NY and have gone to both upscale restaurants as well as holes in the wall and have never seen such poor service.
Most of the wait-staff was very pleasant, or so I assumed because I could not understand what they were saying.
I think that they were just so understaffed that they did their best.
