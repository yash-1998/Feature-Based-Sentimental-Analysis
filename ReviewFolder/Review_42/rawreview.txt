Absolutely charming hotel
I arranged this trip to Paris as a suprise for my partners 50th birthday.
Because of the occasion I wanted this stay to be really special and thanks to the feedback from previous guests I selected this charming hotel and was not let down.
The location is perfect as it is quiet but walking distance to many of the top attractions Paris as to offer.
From the moment we checked in we knew this was going to be a trip to remember, we sat at the bar and sipped on perfectly chilled champagne whilst the hotel offered unbiased advice on nearby restaurants, bars etc.
The actual hotel is fantastic, rooms our a good size for Paris, well designed, fabulous decorations and well maintained.
In addition the housekeeping was excellent.
Unfortunately due to unforseen circumstances we had to cut short our trip at short notice, well after the room had been serviced that day.
The hotel were fantastic and helpful and waived there normal 48 hours notice cancellaton fee for our last night, thankyou.
We will definately return.
