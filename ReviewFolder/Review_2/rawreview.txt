Good Hotel, Minor Complaint
Hotel was nice, yes, maybe it needs updating, but it was fine nonetheless.
It is indeed close to everything, Shopping Malls and Pike's Place Market.
Hotel staff was friendly and helpful.
The only complaint I have is the charge for parking- $35.00 for 2 hours is extremely excessive- especially since I was a hotel guest.
I stayed one night, but the fee for parking, Internet and a bar charge were more than I paid for the room.
