We were treated great from the time we walked in the lobby,we had to wait for a room but it was well worth it! We got an upgrade because it was my husbands b-day while we were there and they knew this ..We had a fun- vacation laughing alot at the entertainment group ,they are an asset to the hotel,Black Banana and Leo kept the pool area and beach hopping and they were all good!! We thought the food was good and the weather couldn't have been better.
