perfect !
I heard about this hotel from a friend, and as
I was in Boston last August, I choose the Westin Waterfront.
The hotel seemed so big and more a business hotel (convention center just next door), but looking carefuly, a lot of families were staying there.
Staff is professionnal and smily (bellman, front desk housekeeping ).
Very lighty lobby (nice atrium) wooden and natural materials everywhere.
I had a very comfortable room with a great view of Downtown Boston, huge bathroom, and fabulous sleeping in heavenly beds, specific to Westin !!
also had a coffee maker with Starbucks in room.
There is a fitness center and a nice indoor pool, which is very appreciated when you walked in town the whole day !
I was visiting friends in Cambridge (opposite side of town), taxi drive is 15minutes from here and costs around $17/way.
Downtown and Historic Boston is a 5-7 minute taxi drive, costs $8/way.
I had breakfast buffet at restaurant Sauciety, simply delicious!
So even if the Westin is situated south of Boston (as they said!),
I would definitely go back there and recommand it to anybody.
