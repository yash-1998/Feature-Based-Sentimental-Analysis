They've raised the bar!
We are originally from Toronto and decided to stay in the entertainment district for a weekend of fun.
We chose this hotel because it had the added full kitchen, and for a family, it's ideal.
We chose the studio room and got one on the 14th floor with a fabulous view of the CN Tower.
Well, the Marriott chain has outdone itself with this Residence Inn location.
I believe it is newly built which is why the room is spotless and not showing any wear yet.Although the hot breakfast buffet is pretty standard fare you can't complain - complimentary breakfast is better than none.
Everything about the room was amazing: upgraded lighting fixtures, super-comfy bed with high thread count sheets, granite (or something like granite) counters in the kitchen and bath, upgraded work desk and table, large bathroom, flat panel TV (that swivels almost 360 degrees), easy to control room temperature settings, nice kitchen appliances and kitchenware (not the cheap stuff).
Super comfortable - truly a home away from home.
We're used to less than stellar service from Torontonians in the service industry, but the staff here are friendly, well trained, and efficient.
A total surprise for us!
Maybe Toronto is changing its ways.
The only complaint is the thin door and huge gap at the bottom of the door which makes any hallway noise seem like it's coming from your own room.
I usually save 5 star ratings for very high end hotels but this one deserves it!
Other notes:1) stay away from the buffet breakfast between 9-10am, it's like a zoo and can get very crowded2) the complimentary wi-fi service is good but slow at times3) parking is $30/night; but valet service is fast and friendly
