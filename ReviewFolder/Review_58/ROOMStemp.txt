We chose this hotel because it had the added full kitchen, and for a family, it's ideal.
I believe it is newly built which is why the room is spotless and not showing any wear yet.Although the hot breakfast buffet is pretty standard fare you can't complain - complimentary breakfast is better than none.
Everything about the room was amazing: upgraded lighting fixtures, super-comfy bed with high thread count sheets, granite (or something like granite) counters in the kitchen and bath, upgraded work desk and table, large bathroom, flat panel TV (that swivels almost 360 degrees), easy to control room temperature settings, nice kitchen appliances and kitchenware (not the cheap stuff).
Super comfortable - truly a home away from home.
The only complaint is the thin door and huge gap at the bottom of the door which makes any hallway noise seem like it's coming from your own room.
