The room was bigger than my first apartment - I challenge you to find a room bigger than this for under $1,000.
An actual working fireplace in the room, but I don't know if they let guests use it.
Charming chair and reading lamp was just beautiful.
The windows overlooked a playground and courtyard, and it was almost silent during our stay.
We were right next to the elevator, and didn't hear a thing.
Big flat panel TV, plus DVD/VCR unit.
The sitting area had a really comfy couch that I slept on w/o any problems (but I am only 5 feet /152cm tall), fridge in room so you can have your own food in there.
The bathroom was HUGE - probably 8x11ft/ 2.4m x 16.7m?)
and also had a window that you could open .
