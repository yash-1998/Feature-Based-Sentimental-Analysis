Lovely Room Lovely room, very attentive staff from front desk to housekeeping to room service.
3 nite stay in mid-July (oh so hot) and truly there simply not enough pool chairs.
Yes it looks like the photo of the pool was taken with photographer on his back, but five lounge chairs and six arm chairs isn't enough on a hot Saturday afternoon after touring the city, with no place to sit.
Otherwise, room had very comfy beds, lots of towels, room amenities replenished and the room AC works great!!
