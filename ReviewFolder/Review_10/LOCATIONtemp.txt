Great hotel for business conventions (part of the reason for my trip), but far from the life of the city.
The only complaint I have is the location.
The Diagonal Mar area around the hotel is one of Barcelona's interventions (urban renewal project).
Nearby is a shopping mall that is indistinuishable from malls anywhere around the world.
