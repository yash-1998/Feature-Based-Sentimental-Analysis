Great modern hotel away from the action in Barcelona
Great hotel for business conventions (part of the reason for my trip), but far from the life of the city.
In a nutshell, the hotel amenities are fine, staff are friendly and very helpful, the restaurant is good and the rooms are comfortable.
A spa/restaurant/pool on the 13th floor is very nice, although I got a bit tired of Hollywood theme songs played at somewhat annoying volumes.
All rooms have a view of either the ocean or the city.
The only complaint I have is the location.
The Diagonal Mar area around the hotel is one of Barcelona's interventions (urban renewal project).
Nearby is a shopping mall that is indistinuishable from malls anywhere around the world.
I would recommend the tappas bar on the far east end of the terrassa, or explore the sidewalk cafes north of the mall.
Access to the city is through bus 41 (about 35 mins to Pl. Catalunya), the yellow metro line (15 mins to Jaume station near Barri Gotic), or a tram that takes you to the Olympic Village via Pl. Glories (about 15 mins).
Taxi access is very good, located just outside the hotel.
