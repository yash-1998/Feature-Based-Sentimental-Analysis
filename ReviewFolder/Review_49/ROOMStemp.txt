It was an unusual residence inn, looking more like an embassy suites internally, but the 2 bed suite we had was lovely, obviously newly renovated and really nicely furnished, plus great LCD TV's.

No matter, the suites were really comfortable and homey and we enjoyed our stay despite the small shortcomings.
