If you are looking to be able to walk out of your hotel door and be in the heart of New Orleans, you are going to pay twice as much than the Maison St. Charles.
If you want easy access to local transportation and the Garden District, great local eateries (Slice is a slice of heaven!) and want to save your travel money to eat and shop-- stay here!
