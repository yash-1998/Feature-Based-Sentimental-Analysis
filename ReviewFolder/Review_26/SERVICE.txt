There were 3 adults but when we arrived they gave us a double room and told us that was all they had, even though they knew that 3 of us were coming.
When I asked for a duvet I was told that they didn't have a spare one!
We had to tell them about stains on the toilet wall twice before it was cleaned.
They then both started to discuss the problem we had infront of us - but not in English!
I thought that was very rude.
