Hallways and room are best summed up as having the appearance of 30 years of Spring Break cavorting without a cleaning, stains on all walls, carpets, and furniture, typical dark W hallways and rooms, poor towels, overpriced water ($8 per bottle), staff with attitude at the front desk, car valets were very good, flies join you for your beakfast without invite, food stains all over the restaurant menus each time the last three stays, $3.25 surcharge for using the ATM and limited to $100 (what will $100 buy you at a W hotel?),
