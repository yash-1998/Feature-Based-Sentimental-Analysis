the dai-ichi hotel tokyo is across the street from the shimbashi train station (there is actually an underground connection), which in addition to a couple of subway lines also has the yamanote jr train line which is great for getting to the various sights (the yamanote line is a circle line that runs around central tokyo and is covered by the jr rail pass)

1) the majority of the staff doesn't speak english, so you'll end up getting the wrong drinks at the bars and the wrong food at the a la carte restaurants 
drinks are bad anyway- either missing alcohol or have the wrong ingredients altogether 
their food sucks 
but the steakhouse is worth trying  
is the best  3) also, if you plan to use included (non-motorized) water sports, you'll have to wait for your boat 2-3 days and deal with a very rude and arrogant staff of scuba caribe (contractors for bahia)

absolutely beautiful  
stayed at the resort from jan 
29-feb 5, 2006 
we went to the resort for our honeymoon, and reading some of the reviews, it made us sceptical of where we were going 
i dont know what people were complaining about, because we had absolutely no problems with anything there 
we went to the steak house (la cava) and it was great 
[('steak house', 6, 4)]
[('great', 1, 13)]

the presentation was awesome and you get large portion meals there 
[('portion meals', 6, 8), ('presentation', 6, 1)]

only i would recommend eating inside the restaurant, instead of eating outside   i got bitten by some flies/bugs out there (about 30 bites on my legs, which were very itchy) 
we also tried the mexican and italian restaurants 
my husband and i both didnt much care for the italian food, however many others seemed to enjoy it 
our favorite was the mexican restaurant, in fact we ended up going there twice during our stay  
the buffet was quite well   we really enjoyed the omlettes in the mornings  
[('buffet', 5, 1), ('omlettes', 6, 9)]

with this you recieve a very relaxing massasge, premium brand drinks, and lots of other little extras 
however, you have to mention to the bartenders that you are vip and tell them that you want 'brugal' rum (the better rum), and the more expensive vodka   otherwise they might mistake you for not being vip and not receiving the better alcohol

we had brought them alot of gifts from home (ex  shampoos, soaps, books, paper, pens, clothes   )
we have no complaints about our room at all   
it was amazing, large bathroom, and a sunk-in living room    it had everything we needed 
we spent half of our stay sun-tanning on the beach, and never had trouble finding a hut or chairs to sit on   dont know what other guests were complaing that they couldnt find a place to sit by the beach 
there we had to wake up a bit earlier to find chairs to sit on 
the lobby bar is quite beautiful and relaxing

some people on tripadvisor have stated how the villas are 'out in the sticks', which seems a little churlish as transport is dirt cheap and you're really not far from anything 
if clubbing in legian is your thing then, fair enough, this may not be what you're after - but if you're after a relaxing holiday where you can take in the island at your own pace, you could do much worse than stay here

i had a 2 room upgrade 
i wouldn't have liked to have stayed in my original room   
it would have been far worse experience than what i had

i had spent two nights at the hotel 1898 on las ramblas before checking in to the cf, and although a night in a standard room at the cf was 110 euro a night more expensive than a superior room at the 1898, the cf truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money i should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the cf for the weekend of november 17th, but i ended up having to change my travel dates due to work

still, my second impression of the cf (the 1st being the absolutely stunning building exterior ?
with bellhops coming and going and groups congregating all over the lobby was ow this is a real hotel?
i would say that the cf and the 1898 are of similar size, but the lobby of the cf was much more lively than the 1898 although they both had high occupancy during my stay

of course, the first thing i noticed as i was walking back up pasaig de gracia towards the hotel was a large grey tour-bus parked outside the hotel 
still, this lobby was crowded in the way i enjoy so i cannot fault it although i expected the standard room at the cf to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the cf had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the hotel de russie in rome

although the cf felt from the start like a real deluxe experience, it proved itself to be such on my very first night there 
regretfully, there was a private event going on at the time and the gentleman at the front desk apologized and offered to have me served in the upstairs library-quite area which i happily accepted

in fact the entire cf reminded me of a smaller version of the de russie 
something about the decor, and the layout of the hallways though i can put my finger on it 
i did have a minor problem with the shower ?
either there was no shower curtain or glass panel to keep the water from spilling all over the place, or i just count figure out how to use it, but i ended up making a minor flood in the bathroom that i had to use up all my towels to dry up 
thankfully when i returned to my room the attendants who had done turn-down service had replaced my wet towels with fresh ones

although the cf felt from the start like a real deluxe experience, it proved itself to be such on my very first night there 
after a long day of sightseeing in the area around palau nacional i wanted to enjoy a glass of wine in the lobby bar before heading off to dinner in town 
regretfully, there was a private event going on at the time and the gentleman at the front desk apologized and offered to have me served in the upstairs library-quite area which i happily accepted

shortly after finding a place to sit where i could write my postcards a waiter appeared to take my order 
when he returned her informed me that the glass of wine was n the house,?
which could not have made me happier 
very unexpected and very, very nice 
skeptics might say that a small gesture like that is not worth the extra euro 110/night over my other choice for accommodation, but to me it makes all the difference i did eventually make my way to the lobby bar after midnight where i enjoyed a glass of cava, finger foods, and deserts

you pay more, but you get so much more 
this was my second trip to bcn and some of the tripadvisor members warned that the area has become a lot more touristy than in it was in 1997, i didn really find that to be the case 
still, lixample is not all that far away from placa catalunya and pasaig de gracia is really so nice to stroll along ?
leisurely or otherwise 
even if you are not a walker, the diagonal metro station is only two stops form the ramblas 
but i wouldn think twice about staying at the cf again 
well maybe the 5 pound room key system really does need to be done away with in favor of a keycard ?

small, expensive and pretentious
i guess i expected more for $450 per night 
what i got was a very small room, staff with a bit of an attitude and a double hold on my credit card amounting to twice the amount i paid for the three nights i was there 
i took nearly a week's worth of phone calls to get these erroneous hold removed from my account

hell hole  
jan 2007 and it was truly horrendous  
check in was a joke, we were waiting ages for our room 
our room was absolutely appalling we had holes in our wall, plug sockets came away from the wall when they were used, holes and cigarette burns in the bedding, the fuse box had no cover (not exactly ideal if you have kids) my boyfriend had 2 open the wardrobe for me everytime i wanted something out of it as it came off its runners and would get jammed 
we had holes in our roof were at night we developed a skylight, the bath was full of chips and marks with limescale and dirt covering the plug hole and shower head, the toilet blatantly hadnt been cleaned for a long time and the only way to open the plug in the sink was by using scissors 
not to mention the general state of the hotel, wires dangling on corridors, smashed roof tiles and cracks in the floor 
the worst bit however had to be 'alcatraz' the buffet restaurant, were birds and flies freely roamed all over the food, this put us off so much that we booked into an a la carte everynight as we refused to eat the contaminated food 
however it was at the a la carte 'roma' where we dined with another couple who we had met on holiday that, my boyfriend, myself and our friends all contracted food poisoning 
we were really ill my boyfriend shaking severely and we all had diarrhoea and vomiting 
this continued for the duration of the holiday and i have still not fully recovered almost a month after being at home 
when we went to the rep about this problem she claimed that 'noone else had reported being ill' although since getting home we have read many reports on the thomson website suggesting otherwise 
almost every day there was a problem with the water so toilets could not be flushed and hands could not be washed, my alcohol wipes for my hands that i took were a saviour 
so it is no wonder that people become ill in these conditions 
we also found the staff to be rude, and we noticed that service was only good if it involved big tips

decor: left a lot to be desired, painting and carpeting was very shoddy and heavily used, it looked like the owner had got a couple of his mates to do the maintenance and they had taken him for a ride, this place seriously feels like a low budget motel, for a high star rated price 
i didn't dare us ethe shower for fear of contracting some nasty fungal growth, bathroom was unacceptably dirty (and the light didn't work)i wouldn't stay here again, there are much better and more professional places for the same price

this is the only place on the resort they have corona beer 
steak/american- my husband enjoyed the steak, you can ask the waiter to look at the different cuts for the steak 
i don't eat red meat this was a challenge for me, i ordered the chicken strips and it was horrible 
if you dont eat steak don't bother going to this restaurant 
only place on the resort they have budweiser beer 
french- we enjoyed this restaurant, we had sole and duck 
the dessert was nothing spectacular

every other day at lunch there was buffet at thalasabuffet- the food is made in large quantity so its not flavorful 
we did not enjoy the service and it was extremely crowded 
crepe restaurant- this was good we went there everyday 
you can order off the menu 
they don't understand english, just point to the item on the menu 
bars/disco- we had challenges with communication as not many of them speak english 
show- the shows are repetitive so we stopped going after a few days 
i would not recommend this for kids there is lots of booty shaking 
amenties: my husband enjoyed the 9 hole golf 
i saw a cockroach once during my stay 
overall: i dont think we will go back to this resort b/c of the language barrier and the fact that i dont eat red meat and i got sick of eating seafood all week 
apprantely in speaking with other travellers this is one of the better 4 5 resorts 
you are getting good value for the price of this resort

my new favourite hotel in paris 
i chose it based on reviews on trip advisor, its location close to jardins de luxembourg (a beautiful spot in paris for a saturday morning stroll) and its convenience for getting to the airport (it is very close to the rer station luxembourg which is on the airport line)

should have been so much better
there were 3 adults but when we arrived they gave us a double room and told us that was all they had, even though they knew that 3 of us were coming 
they arranged for a roll away bed to be put in the room while we went out to eat 
when we came back we had to rearrange the furniture to get around in the room 
the roll away bed had a sheet and a folded blanket on it 
when i asked for a duvet i was told that they didn't have a spare one 
we had to tell them about stains on the toilet wall twice before it was cleaned 
we complained about the room at reception to a lady who spoke to us in english 
a gentleman from reception was speaking to another guest in english 
they then both started to discuss the problem we had infront of us - but not in english 
i thought that was very rude 
the lady then looked to see if she could move us to a sister hotel 
she was not able to so then offered us a refund 
i declined this because if she was unable to get us a room how were we supposed to?
we thought we were going to get 5 star luxury but we didn't 
we were treated like second class citizens 
we have stayed in new york many,many times over the years and this was the most expensive hotel stay and the worst

third and last time: dec 2005booked a club room again 
absolute disaster after hotel stopped being called changi meridien 
first, paid premium for club floor only to find out that the lounge was closed 
second, breakfast at the coffeehouse at the lobby was horrid, having no seats as the place was full of screaming kids and families 
it made me wonder why i bothered to pay extra in the first place 
third, cocktails at the lounge downstairs were a joke 
finally, the room was just a standard room and i could see wear and tear 
when i complained to the manager at the end of my stay, he just shrugged his shoulders and told me to write in formally 
what nonsense i will never stay there again

it took us approximately an hour to finally get the room we had originally reserved and pre-paid for   when we should've originally had it when we walked through the door 
what we did get at first was a standard (non-upgraded) 1 double (small/handicap) room 
by this time, it was a friday night, we had traveled half the day, hungry, tired, and late for a party 
we felt rushed, and it made both of us in a frustrated mood until the party (and even after, when thinking about it) 
when we called for more towels and shampoo, i had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for 
and when i called, the lady sounded bland and bothered 
the towels finally came, but no shampoo (which came later) 
ontop of all of this, no one offered us any sort of compensation or restitution for the mix-up or long wait

the dai-ichi hotel tokyo is across the street from the shimbashi train station (there is actually an underground connection), which in addition to a couple of subway lines also has the yamanote jr train line which is great for getting to the various sights (the yamanote line is a circle line that runs around central tokyo and is covered by the jr rail pass)

small, expensive and pretentious
i guess i expected more for $450 per night 
what i got was a very small room, staff with a bit of an attitude and a double hold on my credit card amounting to twice the amount i paid for the three nights i was there 
i took nearly a week's worth of phone calls to get these erroneous hold removed from my account

awful - don't stay here 
two things: firstly, fisherman's wharf is a really bad location to stay in, in san francisco - none of the best restaurants are in the immediate area, and fisherman's wharf itself is a tacky tourist trap (even san fran residents are embarassed about it)

secondly, if you must stay here, the holiday inn is dire and should be avoided 
on arrival, we were given a room in the beach block (which is a 5 minute walk from reception and nowhere near the waterfront ) 
the room was already occupied and someone's clothes were sill in the room 
on our second attempt, the room we were given was dark, gloomy, a little shabby and overlooked the carpark - albeit it had a large tv and clean bathroom

the swimming pool is small and next to the main road - not worth booking the hotel for this perk

effortless class only 3 mins stroll from the scrum of the
rialto, here is another world, calm and still 
from the brass bell and massive wrought iron gate that open onto the small courtyard, through to all the details of the public areas and rooms, there is an impression of care and attention which must be down to the personal taste and presiding interest of the owners 
don't expect fawning service or overblown breakfasts - this is a place for adults to be treated as such 
we usually check out other hotels in town for future reference - in venice we just didn't bother

as per someone elses view the carpets were shabby shabby shabby, they had a scent 
the top sheet on the beds are not changed when the room is relet  so it means we were induldging in someone elses sweat we had to request the change after noticing dried bits on the bedspread, however the sheets were changed everyday

extremely basic   
asked for a room near to reception which we did get but up a flight of extremely steep stairs 
no offer of help with our bags from staff member who was too busy chatting on msn to concentrate on booking us in vending machines in reception, empty and don't work   
half the light bulbs didn't work, windows wouldn't shut 
laminate floorboards kept moving 
strange looking brown bugs everywhere in room 
food disgusting 
we were persuaded to eat in the restaurant downstairs the first night we were there, tasteless colourless small extortionately expensive portions 
then go to breakfast that's an experience   
a table is laid out with ham and cheese, stale bread rolls and a large bowl of cereals

to top it all, we both came out in a rash that we assumed was an allergic reaction to something, it started on our wrists and spread over our bodies 
imagine how mortified we were when consulted a doctor to discover that we had scabies    
the doctor said it could be caught from dirty beds or bedding 
under no circumstances would we recommend this hotel to anybody

a total surprise for us 
the only complaint is the thin door and huge gap at the bottom of the door which makes any hallway noise seem like it's coming from your own room 
i usually save 5 star ratings for very high end hotels but this one deserves it 
other notes:1) stay away from the buffet breakfast between 9-10am, it's like a zoo and can get very crowded2) the complimentary wi-fi service is good but slow at times3) parking is $30/night; but valet service is fast and friendly

travelers5 good

hotel, but us travelers - beware   
1) the majority of the staff doesn't speak english, so you'll end up getting the wrong drinks at the bars and the wrong food at the a la carte restaurants 
drinks are bad anyway- either missing alcohol or have the wrong ingredients altogether 
suggestion - order straight rum, you'll get more flavor 
2) don't bother making reservations to japanese or french restaurants 
their food sucks 
but the steakhouse is worth trying  
however, their buffet (orchidea ?)
is the best  3) also, if you plan to use included (non-motorized) water sports, you'll have to wait for your boat 2-3 days and deal with a very rude and arrogant staff of scuba caribe (contractors for bahia)

hell hole  
jan 2007 and it was truly horrendous  
check in was a joke, we were waiting ages for our room 
our room was absolutely appalling we had holes in our wall, plug sockets came away from the wall when they were used, holes and cigarette burns in the bedding, the fuse box had no cover (not exactly ideal if you have kids) my boyfriend had 2 open the wardrobe for me everytime i wanted something out of it as it came off its runners and would get jammed 
we had holes in our roof were at night we developed a skylight, the bath was full of chips and marks with limescale and dirt covering the plug hole and shower head, the toilet blatantly hadnt been cleaned for a long time and the only way to open the plug in the sink was by using scissors 
not to mention the general state of the hotel, wires dangling on corridors, smashed roof tiles and cracks in the floor 
the worst bit however had to be 'alcatraz' the buffet restaurant, were birds and flies freely roamed all over the food, this put us off so much that we booked into an a la carte everynight as we refused to eat the contaminated food 
however it was at the a la carte 'roma' where we dined with another couple who we had met on holiday that, my boyfriend, myself and our friends all contracted food poisoning 
we were really ill my boyfriend shaking severely and we all had diarrhoea and vomiting 
this continued for the duration of the holiday and i have still not fully recovered almost a month after being at home 
when we went to the rep about this problem she claimed that 'noone else had reported being ill' although since getting home we have read many reports on the thomson website suggesting otherwise 
saona was filthy, condoms and condom wrappers on the beach (i have stayed in san antonio, ibiza on three occasions and never seen anything like this )
also the toilets were covered in pools of urine and absolutely stank 
rancho jonathan was definately not up2 uk standards, my friend teaches horse riding and she was mortified when i told her what happened to us sanitation in general in the hotel was appalling we were left without electricity on some occasions which meant we also did not have running water 
almost every day there was a problem with the water so toilets could not be flushed and hands could not be washed, my alcohol wipes for my hands that i took were a saviour 
so it is no wonder that people become ill in these conditions 
we also found the staff to be rude, and we noticed that service was only good if it involved big tips

london cold and snooty
i booked a stay at the london because i was curious about the changes they made from the former rhiga royale 
i was totally unimpressed 
the bedroom was left dirty, we found discarded garbage next to our bed 
we also found there was nowhere to store your luggage 
what happened to closet space?
we had a cold, boring room 
no art on the walls, nothing 
to be fair, i liked the bathroom

bell hop went out of his way to have a taxi wait for us that was scheduled to take us back to the airport 
the room we had faced a brick wall, so there was no sunlight at all 
the room itself was very small but it suited our needs, which was basically to have a clean place to relax and to sleep

there were 3 adults but when we arrived they gave us a double room and told us that was all they had, even though they knew that 3 of us were coming 
when we came back we had to rearrange the furniture to get around in the room 
the roll away bed had a sheet and a folded blanket on it 
when i asked for a duvet i was told that they didn't have a spare one 
we had to tell them about stains on the toilet wall twice before it was cleaned 
they then both started to discuss the problem we had infront of us - but not in english 
i thought that was very rude 
the lady then looked to see if she could move us to a sister hotel 
she was not able to so then offered us a refund 
i declined this because if she was unable to get us a room how were we supposed to?
we thought we were going to get 5 star luxury but we didn't 
we were treated like second class citizens 
we have stayed in new york many,many times over the years and this was the most expensive hotel stay and the worst

declining standards stayed at this hotel on 3 seperate occasions, and standards keep slipping 
absolute disaster after hotel stopped being called changi meridien 
first, paid premium for club floor only to find out that the lounge was closed 
second, breakfast at the coffeehouse at the lobby was horrid, having no seats as the place was full of screaming kids and families 
third, cocktails at the lounge downstairs were a joke 
finally, the room was just a standard room and i could see wear and tear 
when i complained to the manager at the end of my stay, he just shrugged his shoulders and told me to write in formally 
what nonsense i will never stay there again

it took us approximately an hour to finally get the room we had originally reserved and pre-paid for   when we should've originally had it when we walked through the door 
what we did get at first was a standard (non-upgraded) 1 double (small/handicap) room 
when we called for more towels and shampoo, i had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for 
and when i called, the lady sounded bland and bothered 
the towels finally came, but no shampoo (which came later) 
ontop of all of this, no one offered us any sort of compensation or restitution for the mix-up or long wait

awful - don't stay here 
two things: firstly, fisherman's wharf is a really bad location to stay in, in san francisco - none of the best restaurants are in the immediate area, and fisherman's wharf itself is a tacky tourist trap (even san fran residents are embarassed about it)

secondly, if you must stay here, the holiday inn is dire and should be avoided 
on arrival, we were given a room in the beach block (which is a 5 minute walk from reception and nowhere near the waterfront ) 
the room was already occupied and someone's clothes were sill in the room 
on our second attempt, the room we were given was dark, gloomy, a little shabby and overlooked the carpark - albeit it had a large tv and clean bathroom

the swimming pool is small and next to the main road - not worth booking the hotel for this perk

effortless class only 3 mins stroll from the scrum of the
rialto, here is another world, calm and still 
from the brass bell and massive wrought iron gate that open onto the small courtyard, through to all the details of the public areas and rooms, there is an impression of care and attention which must be down to the personal taste and presiding interest of the owners 
don't expect fawning service or overblown breakfasts - this is a place for adults to be treated as such

only i would recommend eating inside the restaurant, instead of eating outside   i got bitten by some flies/bugs out there (about 30 bites on my legs, which were very itchy) 
my husband and i both didnt much care for the italian food, however many others seemed to enjoy it 
our favorite was the mexican restaurant, in fact we ended up going there twice during our stay  
the buffet was quite well   we really enjoyed the omlettes in the mornings

we have no complaints about our room at all   
it was amazing, large bathroom, and a sunk-in living room    it had everything we needed 
we spent half of our stay sun-tanning on the beach, and never had trouble finding a hut or chairs to sit on   dont know what other guests were complaing that they couldnt find a place to sit by the beach

we had booked a tour with turinter (air canada affiliated) for the sanoa island tour, however that morning the bus that was suppose to pick us up, along with 8 others from our resort, accidentaly missed our resort and left without us all 
it was no problem at all dealing with them about this issue 
they were more than willing to either re-book us, or return our money back in full

we decided not to re-book seeing it was one of our last days there, and heard from others that went on the tour that it actually wasnt worth the $80 american/person 
they didnt have entertainment on the boat ride at all and never saw any fish on their whole tour 
overall, my husband and i would definately recommend the resort though 
it was absolutely gorgeous and the staff there was amazing

some people on tripadvisor have stated how the villas are 'out in the sticks', which seems a little churlish as transport is dirt cheap and you're really not far from anything 
if clubbing in legian is your thing then, fair enough, this may not be what you're after - but if you're after a relaxing holiday where you can take in the island at your own pace, you could do much worse than stay here

extremely basic   
asked for a room near to reception which we did get but up a flight of extremely steep stairs 
no offer of help with our bags from staff member who was too busy chatting on msn to concentrate on booking us in vending machines in reception, empty and don't work   
half the light bulbs didn't work, windows wouldn't shut 
laminate floorboards kept moving 
strange looking brown bugs everywhere in room 
food disgusting 
we were persuaded to eat in the restaurant downstairs the first night we were there, tasteless colourless small extortionately expensive portions 
then go to breakfast that's an experience   
a table is laid out with ham and cheese, stale bread rolls and a large bowl of cereals

to top it all, we both came out in a rash that we assumed was an allergic reaction to something, it started on our wrists and spread over our bodies 
imagine how mortified we were when consulted a doctor to discover that we had scabies    
the doctor said it could be caught from dirty beds or bedding 
under no circumstances would we recommend this hotel to anybody

hotel, but us travelers - beware   
1) the majority of the staff doesn't speak english, so you'll end up getting the wrong drinks at the bars and the wrong food at the a la carte restaurants 
drinks are bad anyway- either missing alcohol or have the wrong ingredients altogether 
suggestion - order straight rum, you'll get more flavor 
2) don't bother making reservations to japanese or french restaurants 
their food sucks 
but the steakhouse is worth trying  
however, their buffet (orchidea ?)
is the best  3) also, if you plan to use included (non-motorized) water sports, you'll have to wait for your boat 2-3 days and deal with a very rude and arrogant staff of scuba caribe (contractors for bahia)

be prepared to pay for everything 
internet access was $10 
there is a charge if you want to print something

[('bed', 1, 0)]
[('nice', 1, 2)]


bed1 nice

there was no room to put down my 3 suitcases 
the balcony/lanai frightened me   
it was old and i wondered how much rust was being covered by the paint 
i might fall over if i lent on the bars 
it would have been far worse experience than what i had 
i'd give it about a 3 or 4 out of 10  
looks nothing like the picture in brochures   
for value for money, the royal hawaiian, moama surf or sheraton might be approx $100 per night dearer, but you are getting about $400 more in value

i had spent two nights at the hotel 1898 on las ramblas before checking in to the cf, and although a night in a standard room at the cf was 110 euro a night more expensive than a superior room at the 1898, the cf truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money i should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the cf for the weekend of november 17th, but i ended up having to change my travel dates due to work

still, my second impression of the cf (the 1st being the absolutely stunning building exterior ?
still, this lobby was crowded in the way i enjoy so i cannot fault it although i expected the standard room at the cf to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the cf had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the hotel de russie in rome 
[('lobby', 5, 3), ('way', 0, 8), ('room', 1, 22), ('room', 1, 31), ('room', 1, 37), ('bathroom', 0, 50), ('bathroom', 0, 54), ('hotel', 0, 57)]

in fact the entire cf reminded me of a smaller version of the de russie 
something about the decor, and the layout of the hallways though i can put my finger on it 
i did have a minor problem with the shower ?
either there was no shower curtain or glass panel to keep the water from spilling all over the place, or i just count figure out how to use it, but i ended up making a minor flood in the bathroom that i had to use up all my towels to dry up 
thankfully when i returned to my room the attendants who had done turn-down service had replaced my wet towels with fresh ones

although the cf felt from the start like a real deluxe experience, it proved itself to be such on my very first night there 
regretfully, there was a private event going on at the time and the gentleman at the front desk apologized and offered to have me served in the upstairs library-quite area which i happily accepted

skeptics might say that a small gesture like that is not worth the extra euro 110/night over my other choice for accommodation, but to me it makes all the difference i did eventually make my way to the lobby bar after midnight where i enjoyed a glass of cava, finger foods, and deserts

although i would stay at the 1898 again, if i budget was not a constraint i would choose the cf hands down 
you pay more, but you get so much more 
still, lixample is not all that far away from placa catalunya and pasaig de gracia is really so nice to stroll along ?
i cannot fault the experience ?
well maybe the 5 pound room key system really does need to be done away with in favor of a keycard ?

hell hole  
jan 2007 and it was truly horrendous  
check in was a joke, we were waiting ages for our room 
our room was absolutely appalling we had holes in our wall, plug sockets came away from the wall when they were used, holes and cigarette burns in the bedding, the fuse box had no cover (not exactly ideal if you have kids) my boyfriend had 2 open the wardrobe for me everytime i wanted something out of it as it came off its runners and would get jammed 
we had holes in our roof were at night we developed a skylight, the bath was full of chips and marks with limescale and dirt covering the plug hole and shower head, the toilet blatantly hadnt been cleaned for a long time and the only way to open the plug in the sink was by using scissors 
not to mention the general state of the hotel, wires dangling on corridors, smashed roof tiles and cracks in the floor 
the worst bit however had to be 'alcatraz' the buffet restaurant, were birds and flies freely roamed all over the food, this put us off so much that we booked into an a la carte everynight as we refused to eat the contaminated food 
however it was at the a la carte 'roma' where we dined with another couple who we had met on holiday that, my boyfriend, myself and our friends all contracted food poisoning 
we were really ill my boyfriend shaking severely and we all had diarrhoea and vomiting 
this continued for the duration of the holiday and i have still not fully recovered almost a month after being at home 
when we went to the rep about this problem she claimed that 'noone else had reported being ill' although since getting home we have read many reports on the thomson website suggesting otherwise 
rancho jonathan was definately not up2 uk standards, my friend teaches horse riding and she was mortified when i told her what happened to us sanitation in general in the hotel was appalling we were left without electricity on some occasions which meant we also did not have running water 
almost every day there was a problem with the water so toilets could not be flushed and hands could not be washed, my alcohol wipes for my hands that i took were a saviour 
we also found the staff to be rude, and we noticed that service was only good if it involved big tips

there were 3 adults but when we arrived they gave us a double room and told us that was all they had, even though they knew that 3 of us were coming 
when we came back we had to rearrange the furniture to get around in the room 
when i asked for a duvet i was told that they didn't have a spare one 
we had to tell them about stains on the toilet wall twice before it was cleaned 
they then both started to discuss the problem we had infront of us - but not in english 
i thought that was very rude 
i declined this because if she was unable to get us a room how were we supposed to?
we were treated like second class citizens 
we have stayed in new york many,many times over the years and this was the most expensive hotel stay and the worst

gym was wonderful too vowed to return 
absolute disaster after hotel stopped being called changi meridien 
second, breakfast at the coffeehouse at the lobby was horrid, having no seats as the place was full of screaming kids and families 
it made me wonder why i bothered to pay extra in the first place 
third, cocktails at the lounge downstairs were a joke 
finally, the room was just a standard room and i could see wear and tear 
when i complained to the manager at the end of my stay, he just shrugged his shoulders and told me to write in formally 
what nonsense i will never stay there again

it took us approximately an hour to finally get the room we had originally reserved and pre-paid for   when we should've originally had it when we walked through the door 
what we did get at first was a standard (non-upgraded) 1 double (small/handicap) room 
when we called for more towels and shampoo, i had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for 
and when i called, the lady sounded bland and bothered 
ontop of all of this, no one offered us any sort of compensation or restitution for the mix-up or long wait
