a spa/restaurant/pool on the 13th floor is very nice, although i got a bit tired of hollywood theme songs played at somewhat annoying volumes

perfect  
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the hotel seemed so big and more a business hotel (convention center just next door), but looking carefuly, a lot of families were staying there 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
staff is professionnal and smily (bellman, front desk housekeeping ) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
very lighty lobby (nice atrium) wooden and natural materials everywhere

we ordered off of the menu and it took an extremely long time for our food to come, and the place was not busy at all

the food was good however, when it finally did arrive i believe on our next trip we will stay either on the north shore, or near waikiki, just to be closer to everything

the dai-ichi hotel tokyo is across the street from the shimbashi train station (there is actually an underground connection), which in addition to a couple of subway lines also has the yamanote jr train line which is great for getting to the various sights (the yamanote line is a circle line that runs around central tokyo and is covered by the jr rail pass)

as has also been mentioned, the hotel is only a 15 minute walk to the fish market which is very handy as the action there starts before the subway begin operation in the morning

we got a very good price for this hotel on expedia (cad$160/night) - a price/quality combination that we would be hard pressed to match in any north american hotel

the only word of caution would be directed towards very light sleepers as the hotel is next to the train tracks and at times some noise can filter through to the room

ritz (except the fitness center) have stayed in ritz/four seasons properties in several cities and this one followed in line; prompt service, individualized welcome card upon check-in (not that i need that kind of thing), clean, comfortable room and beds - and the requisite ferraris, porshes and escalades parked front and center with the valet

still ticks me off that the ritz and other 4/5 star hotels charge an extra $10 for internet access, but guess most are just expensing it through on business accounts anyway, but just include it in the room rate - i can get free access at best westerns

awful - don't stay here 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
two things: firstly, fisherman's wharf is a really bad location to stay in, in san francisco - none of the best restaurants are in the immediate area, and fisherman's wharf itself is a tacky tourist trap (even san fran residents are embarassed about it)

secondly, if you must stay here, the holiday inn is dire and should be avoided

-----------------------------------------------------------------
the room was already occupied and someone's clothes were sill in the room

on our second attempt, the room we were given was dark, gloomy, a little shabby and overlooked the carpark - albeit it had a large tv and clean bathroom

the swimming pool is small and next to the main road - not worth booking the hotel for this perk

when we checked out, it took a twenty minute wait as the reception staff were clearly overworked and underpaid

food: the main eating place in the holiday inn is a denny's - a real crime to eat in this chain when there are so many excellent one-off places throughout the city (e g  mama's near washington square for brunch, tomasso's in the north beach for dinner)

from the brass bell and massive wrought iron gate that open onto the small courtyard, through to all the details of the public areas and rooms, there is an impression of care and attention which must be down to the personal taste and presiding interest of the owners

we usually check out other hotels in town for future reference - in venice we just didn't bother

if tokyo is the only city you're visiting i'd probably recommend a different hotel as shinjuku is a business district and pretty quiet at night unless you hang out at the station (the shuttle service ends around 9:30pm)

only downside is the jr to kyoto/osaka leaves from tokyo station, so you have to change stations if you venture west

i had spent two nights at the hotel 1898 on las ramblas before checking in to the cf, and although a night in a standard room at the cf was 110 euro a night more expensive than a superior room at the 1898, the cf truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money i should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the cf for the weekend of november 17th, but i ended up having to change my travel dates due to work

[('exterior', 3)]
[('stunning', 1)]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
with bellhops coming and going and groups congregating all over the lobby was ow this is a real hotel?

i would say that the cf and the 1898 are of similar size, but the lobby of the cf was much more lively than the 1898 although they both had high occupancy during my stay

-----------------------------------------------------------------
of course, the first thing i noticed as i was walking back up pasaig de gracia towards the hotel was a large grey tour-bus parked outside the hotel 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
still, this lobby was crowded in the way i enjoy so i cannot fault it although i expected the standard room at the cf to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the cf had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the hotel de russie in rome

in fact the entire cf reminded me of a smaller version of the de russie 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
something about the decor, and the layout of the hallways though i can put my finger on it 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
i did have a minor problem with the shower ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
either there was no shower curtain or glass panel to keep the water from spilling all over the place, or i just count figure out how to use it, but i ended up making a minor flood in the bathroom that i had to use up all my towels to dry up 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
thankfully when i returned to my room the attendants who had done turn-down service had replaced my wet towels with fresh ones

-----------------------------------------------------------------
although the cf felt from the start like a real deluxe experience, it proved itself to be such on my very first night there 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
after a long day of sightseeing in the area around palau nacional i wanted to enjoy a glass of wine in the lobby bar before heading off to dinner in town

regretfully, there was a private event going on at the time and the gentleman at the front desk apologized and offered to have me served in the upstairs library-quite area which i happily accepted

when he returned her informed me that the glass of wine was n the house,?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
which could not have made me happier 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
very unexpected and very, very nice 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
skeptics might say that a small gesture like that is not worth the extra euro 110/night over my other choice for accommodation, but to me it makes all the difference i did eventually make my way to the lobby bar after midnight where i enjoyed a glass of cava, finger foods, and deserts

-----------------------------------------------------------------
this was my second trip to bcn and some of the tripadvisor members warned that the area has become a lot more touristy than in it was in 1997, i didn really find that to be the case 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
still, lixample is not all that far away from placa catalunya and pasaig de gracia is really so nice to stroll along ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
leisurely or otherwise 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
even if you are not a walker, the diagonal metro station is only two stops form the ramblas

but i wouldn think twice about staying at the cf again

small, expensive and pretentious

i guess i expected more for $450 per night

what i got was a very small room, staff with a bit of an attitude and a double hold on my credit card amounting to twice the amount i paid for the three nights i was there

[('jan', 5)]

check in was a joke, we were waiting ages for our room 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
our room was absolutely appalling we had holes in our wall, plug sockets came away from the wall when they were used, holes and cigarette burns in the bedding, the fuse box had no cover (not exactly ideal if you have kids) my boyfriend had 2 open the wardrobe for me everytime i wanted something out of it as it came off its runners and would get jammed 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we had holes in our roof were at night we developed a skylight, the bath was full of chips and marks with limescale and dirt covering the plug hole and shower head, the toilet blatantly hadnt been cleaned for a long time and the only way to open the plug in the sink was by using scissors

-----------------------------------------------------------------
not to mention the general state of the hotel, wires dangling on corridors, smashed roof tiles and cracks in the floor

the worst bit however had to be 'alcatraz' the buffet restaurant, were birds and flies freely roamed all over the food, this put us off so much that we booked into an a la carte everynight as we refused to eat the contaminated food

however it was at the a la carte 'roma' where we dined with another couple who we had met on holiday that, my boyfriend, myself and our friends all contracted food poisoning 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we were really ill my boyfriend shaking severely and we all had diarrhoea and vomiting 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
this continued for the duration of the holiday and i have still not fully recovered almost a month after being at home 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
when we went to the rep about this problem she claimed that 'noone else had reported being ill' although since getting home we have read many reports on the thomson website suggesting otherwise 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
almost every day there was a problem with the water so toilets could not be flushed and hands could not be washed, my alcohol wipes for my hands that i took were a saviour 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
so it is no wonder that people become ill in these conditions 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we also found the staff to be rude, and we noticed that service was only good if it involved big tips

my new favourite hotel in paris 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
i chose it based on reviews on trip advisor, its location close to jardins de luxembourg (a beautiful spot in paris for a saturday morning stroll) and its convenience for getting to the airport (it is very close to the rer station luxembourg which is on the airport line) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the rates were very good on the hotel's website (summer special) 
[('summer special', 4), ('rates', 0), ('hotel', 0), ('website', 1)]

if you can get this hotel at a good price i would defintely recommend it

the breakfast (?

unfortunately there were no other rooms available that weekend to upgrade to

should have been so much better
-----------------------------------------------------------------
there were 3 adults but when we arrived they gave us a double room and told us that was all they had, even though they knew that 3 of us were coming 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
they arranged for a roll away bed to be put in the room while we went out to eat 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
when we came back we had to rearrange the furniture to get around in the room 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the roll away bed had a sheet and a folded blanket on it 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
when i asked for a duvet i was told that they didn't have a spare one 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we had to tell them about stains on the toilet wall twice before it was cleaned 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we complained about the room at reception to a lady who spoke to us in english 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
a gentleman from reception was speaking to another guest in english 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
they then both started to discuss the problem we had infront of us - but not in english 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
i thought that was very rude 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the lady then looked to see if she could move us to a sister hotel 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
she was not able to so then offered us a refund 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
i declined this because if she was unable to get us a room how were we supposed to?

we thought we were going to get 5 star luxury but we didn't

second time: mid-2005booked a room on the club floor, hoping to get a room similar to my last visit 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
pleasantly surprised when given a large corner room, racing the greenery with sitting area 
[('corner', 1), ('room', 0), ('area', 1)]

third and last time: dec 2005booked a club room again 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
absolute disaster after hotel stopped being called changi meridien 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
first, paid premium for club floor only to find out that the lounge was closed 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
second, breakfast at the coffeehouse at the lobby was horrid, having no seats as the place was full of screaming kids and families

it made me wonder why i bothered to pay extra in the first place 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
third, cocktails at the lounge downstairs were a joke 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
finally, the room was just a standard room and i could see wear and tear 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
when i complained to the manager at the end of my stay, he just shrugged his shoulders and told me to write in formally 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
what nonsense i will never stay there again 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

we had made a prior reservation 5 days before-hand, and confirmed the day before that we had paid for and would stay in an upgraded 1 king room 
[('days', 1), ('day', 0), ('king', 1), ('room', 0)]

-----------------------------------------------------------------
it took us approximately an hour to finally get the room we had originally reserved and pre-paid for   when we should've originally had it when we walked through the door 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
what we did get at first was a standard (non-upgraded) 1 double (small/handicap) room 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
by this time, it was a friday night, we had traveled half the day, hungry, tired, and late for a party 
[('time', 0), ('night', 0), ('day', 0), ('party', 3)]

we felt rushed, and it made both of us in a frustrated mood until the party (and even after, when thinking about it) 
[('party', 3)]
[('frustrated', -1)]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
when we called for more towels and shampoo, i had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
and when i called, the lady sounded bland and bothered 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the towels finally came, but no shampoo (which came later) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
ontop of all of this, no one offered us any sort of compensation or restitution for the mix-up or long wait

the dai-ichi hotel tokyo is across the street from the shimbashi train station (there is actually an underground connection), which in addition to a couple of subway lines also has the yamanote jr train line which is great for getting to the various sights (the yamanote line is a circle line that runs around central tokyo and is covered by the jr rail pass)

this means that if you are coming in from narita airport all your have to do is take the narita express to tokyo station and then get on the yamanote line and travel two stops to shimbashi

in addition to great transportation, there are also numerous restaurants and coffee shops in the surrounding streets, including a full supermarket in the shimbashi station

small, expensive and pretentious
-----------------------------------------------------------------
i guess i expected more for $450 per night

what i got was a very small room, staff with a bit of an attitude and a double hold on my credit card amounting to twice the amount i paid for the three nights i was there

awful - don't stay here 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
two things: firstly, fisherman's wharf is a really bad location to stay in, in san francisco - none of the best restaurants are in the immediate area, and fisherman's wharf itself is a tacky tourist trap (even san fran residents are embarassed about it)

secondly, if you must stay here, the holiday inn is dire and should be avoided

on arrival, we were given a room in the beach block (which is a 5 minute walk from reception and nowhere near the waterfront ) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the room was already occupied and someone's clothes were sill in the room

on our second attempt, the room we were given was dark, gloomy, a little shabby and overlooked the carpark - albeit it had a large tv and clean bathroom

rialto, here is another world, calm and still

from the brass bell and massive wrought iron gate that open onto the small courtyard, through to all the details of the public areas and rooms, there is an impression of care and attention which must be down to the personal taste and presiding interest of the owners

each morning we left the room at 09:30 and pressed a button to request room to be cleaned so it was dissapointing to find room not cleaned on our return i mentioned this a checkout and even filled out a form so i hope this problem will be sorted out we had a great time at langham place and would stay here again when i next visit hong kong

i usually save 5 star ratings for very high end hotels but this one deserves it

-----------------------------------------------------------------
hotel, but us travelers - beware   
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1) the majority of the staff doesn't speak english, so you'll end up getting the wrong drinks at the bars and the wrong food at the a la carte restaurants

suggestion - order straight rum, you'll get more flavor

2) don't bother making reservations to japanese or french restaurants 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
their food sucks 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
but the steakhouse is worth trying  
-----------------------------------------------------------------
however, their buffet (orchidea ?)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
is the best  3) also, if you plan to use included (non-motorized) water sports, you'll have to wait for your boat 2-3 days and deal with a very rude and arrogant staff of scuba caribe (contractors for bahia)

:))on this note, fetch some beach towels to the room when you want to take a shower 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the bathroom is designed the way that it gets flooded when you take a shower (no shower curtains), so you'll somehow need to contain all that water till the morining , when the cleaning lady comes in   summary is - beaches (sandals ) is still the best among the carribean all-inclusives

hell hole

jan 2007 and it was truly horrendous  
[('jan', 5)]
[('horrendous', -1)]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
check in was a joke, we were waiting ages for our room 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
our room was absolutely appalling we had holes in our wall, plug sockets came away from the wall when they were used, holes and cigarette burns in the bedding, the fuse box had no cover (not exactly ideal if you have kids) my boyfriend had 2 open the wardrobe for me everytime i wanted something out of it as it came off its runners and would get jammed 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we had holes in our roof were at night we developed a skylight, the bath was full of chips and marks with limescale and dirt covering the plug hole and shower head, the toilet blatantly hadnt been cleaned for a long time and the only way to open the plug in the sink was by using scissors

-----------------------------------------------------------------
not to mention the general state of the hotel, wires dangling on corridors, smashed roof tiles and cracks in the floor 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the worst bit however had to be 'alcatraz' the buffet restaurant, were birds and flies freely roamed all over the food, this put us off so much that we booked into an a la carte everynight as we refused to eat the contaminated food

-----------------------------------------------------------------
however it was at the a la carte 'roma' where we dined with another couple who we had met on holiday that, my boyfriend, myself and our friends all contracted food poisoning 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we were really ill my boyfriend shaking severely and we all had diarrhoea and vomiting 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
this continued for the duration of the holiday and i have still not fully recovered almost a month after being at home 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
when we went to the rep about this problem she claimed that 'noone else had reported being ill' although since getting home we have read many reports on the thomson website suggesting otherwise 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
saona was filthy, condoms and condom wrappers on the beach (i have stayed in san antonio, ibiza on three occasions and never seen anything like this )
[('beach', 0), ('occasions', 0), ('anything', 0)]

-----------------------------------------------------------------
also the toilets were covered in pools of urine and absolutely stank 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
rancho jonathan was definately not up2 uk standards, my friend teaches horse riding and she was mortified when i told her what happened to us sanitation in general in the hotel was appalling we were left without electricity on some occasions which meant we also did not have running water 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
almost every day there was a problem with the water so toilets could not be flushed and hands could not be washed, my alcohol wipes for my hands that i took were a saviour 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
so it is no wonder that people become ill in these conditions 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we also found the staff to be rude, and we noticed that service was only good if it involved big tips

on a positive note the beach outside the hotel was really nice and the monster trucking trip was really good, just a shame about the rest of the holiday, we feel completely ripped off and disappointed and its definately put us off returning to the carribean

there were 3 adults but when we arrived they gave us a double room and told us that was all they had, even though they knew that 3 of us were coming

the roll away bed had a sheet and a folded blanket on it

when i asked for a duvet i was told that they didn't have a spare one

we had to tell them about stains on the toilet wall twice before it was cleaned

they then both started to discuss the problem we had infront of us - but not in english

i thought that was very rude 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the lady then looked to see if she could move us to a sister hotel

it took us approximately an hour to finally get the room we had originally reserved and pre-paid for   when we should've originally had it when we walked through the door 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
what we did get at first was a standard (non-upgraded) 1 double (small/handicap) room 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
when we called for more towels and shampoo, i had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
and when i called, the lady sounded bland and bothered 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the towels finally came, but no shampoo (which came later)

the dai-ichi hotel tokyo is across the street from the shimbashi train station (there is actually an underground connection), which in addition to a couple of subway lines also has the yamanote jr train line which is great for getting to the various sights (the yamanote line is a circle line that runs around central tokyo and is covered by the jr rail pass)

this means that if you are coming in from narita airport all your have to do is take the narita express to tokyo station and then get on the yamanote line and travel two stops to shimbashi

awful - don't stay here

a top choice in barcelona

[('top', 1)]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
i had spent two nights at the hotel 1898 on las ramblas before checking in to the cf, and although a night in a standard room at the cf was 110 euro a night more expensive than a superior room at the 1898, the cf truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money i should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the cf for the weekend of november 17th, but i ended up having to change my travel dates due to work

[('expensive', -1), ('superior', 1)]

obviously, it would have been great to get the cheaper rate, but i would pay the higher rate again for a chance to stay at the casa fuster where the service and the accommodations are truly top notch

[('exterior', 3)]
[('stunning', 1)]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
still, this lobby was crowded in the way i enjoy so i cannot fault it although i expected the standard room at the cf to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the cf had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the hotel de russie in rome

-----------------------------------------------------------------
in fact the entire cf reminded me of a smaller version of the de russie 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
something about the decor, and the layout of the hallways though i can put my finger on it 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
i did have a minor problem with the shower ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
either there was no shower curtain or glass panel to keep the water from spilling all over the place, or i just count figure out how to use it, but i ended up making a minor flood in the bathroom that i had to use up all my towels to dry up 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
thankfully when i returned to my room the attendants who had done turn-down service had replaced my wet towels with fresh ones

although the cf felt from the start like a real deluxe experience, it proved itself to be such on my very first night there 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
regretfully, there was a private event going on at the time and the gentleman at the front desk apologized and offered to have me served in the upstairs library-quite area which i happily accepted

skeptics might say that a small gesture like that is not worth the extra euro 110/night over my other choice for accommodation, but to me it makes all the difference i did eventually make my way to the lobby bar after midnight where i enjoyed a glass of cava, finger foods, and deserts

although i would stay at the 1898 again, if i budget was not a constraint i would choose the cf hands down

you pay more, but you get so much more

still, lixample is not all that far away from placa catalunya and pasaig de gracia is really so nice to stroll along ?

hell hole

jan 2007 and it was truly horrendous  
[('jan', 5)]
[('horrendous', -1)]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
check in was a joke, we were waiting ages for our room 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
our room was absolutely appalling we had holes in our wall, plug sockets came away from the wall when they were used, holes and cigarette burns in the bedding, the fuse box had no cover (not exactly ideal if you have kids) my boyfriend had 2 open the wardrobe for me everytime i wanted something out of it as it came off its runners and would get jammed 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we had holes in our roof were at night we developed a skylight, the bath was full of chips and marks with limescale and dirt covering the plug hole and shower head, the toilet blatantly hadnt been cleaned for a long time and the only way to open the plug in the sink was by using scissors

-----------------------------------------------------------------
not to mention the general state of the hotel, wires dangling on corridors, smashed roof tiles and cracks in the floor 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the worst bit however had to be 'alcatraz' the buffet restaurant, were birds and flies freely roamed all over the food, this put us off so much that we booked into an a la carte everynight as we refused to eat the contaminated food

-----------------------------------------------------------------
however it was at the a la carte 'roma' where we dined with another couple who we had met on holiday that, my boyfriend, myself and our friends all contracted food poisoning 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we were really ill my boyfriend shaking severely and we all had diarrhoea and vomiting 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
this continued for the duration of the holiday and i have still not fully recovered almost a month after being at home 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
when we went to the rep about this problem she claimed that 'noone else had reported being ill' although since getting home we have read many reports on the thomson website suggesting otherwise 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
rancho jonathan was definately not up2 uk standards, my friend teaches horse riding and she was mortified when i told her what happened to us sanitation in general in the hotel was appalling we were left without electricity on some occasions which meant we also did not have running water 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
almost every day there was a problem with the water so toilets could not be flushed and hands could not be washed, my alcohol wipes for my hands that i took were a saviour 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
we also found the staff to be rude, and we noticed that service was only good if it involved big tips

my new favourite hotel in paris 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
i chose it based on reviews on trip advisor, its location close to jardins de luxembourg (a beautiful spot in paris for a saturday morning stroll) and its convenience for getting to the airport (it is very close to the rer station luxembourg which is on the airport line)

the rates were very good on the hotel's website (summer special)

should have been so much better
-----------------------------------------------------------------
there were 3 adults but when we arrived they gave us a double room and told us that was all they had, even though they knew that 3 of us were coming

when we came back we had to rearrange the furniture to get around in the room 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
when i asked for a duvet i was told that they didn't have a spare one

we had to tell them about stains on the toilet wall twice before it was cleaned

they then both started to discuss the problem we had infront of us - but not in english

it took us approximately an hour to finally get the room we had originally reserved and pre-paid for   when we should've originally had it when we walked through the door

what we did get at first was a standard (non-upgraded) 1 double (small/handicap) room

when we called for more towels and shampoo, i had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for
