14 I Had Great Experience I little worried I read recent reviews hotel .I 'm glad I chose stay Singel The desk clerk joked I smallest room Amsterdam probably right suited needs perfectly clean quiet room amenities shower TV w/cable .I requested non-smoking room room bright modern airy smoke-free The location fabulous - near Centraal Station quiet canal virtually city center close western side town great shops restaurants .Breakfast Singel included array meats cheeses fruit toasts yogurt granola juice .Each table gets carafe coffee/tea .Friendly service - yes leave room key common Europe Would I stay ? Yes .
15 A top choice Barcelona I spent two nights Casa Fuster 26-28 November .I spent two nights Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas checking CF although night Standard room CF 110 Euro night expensive Superior room 1898 CF truly different class 1898 worth extra money .I say however local travel agent quoted rate Euro 240/night inclusive breakfast CF weekend November 17th I ended change travel dates due work .For days I traveled \u9225 ? even though I stay CF weekend \u9225 ? much expensive \u9225 ? Euro 330/night including breakfast .Obviously would great get cheaper rate I would pay higher rate chance stay Casa Fuster service accommodations truly top notch .Let mention I love-hate relationship large hotels .I like hustle bustle crowded lobbies get kind depressed I staying smaller boutique hotels empty-ghost town lobbies .That doesn\u9225\u6a9b mean I fan large numbers tour busses dropping tourists gawk gape wait line afternoon tea .Still second impression CF 1st absolutely stunning building exterior \u9225 ? wow bellhops coming going groups congregating lobby \u9225\u6e18ow real hotel\u9225 ? I would say CF 1898 similar size lobby CF much lively 1898 although high occupancy stay .The 1898 somewhat larger lobby however may account seemed sparkly populated .After check I decided walk around town bit .Of course first thing I noticed I walking back Pasaig de Gracia towards hotel Large grey tour-bus parked outside hotel .Oh well .Guess cant crowded lobby without obligatory tour bus parked outside .Still lobby crowded way I enjoy I fault Although I expected Standard room CF smaller superior room 1898 room CF large luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent bathroom Hotel de Russie Rome .I think bathroom important part hotel room would gladly give extra room real estate would buy larger bathroom .You could comfortably fit two people bathroom I appreciated even though I traveling alone .In fact entire CF reminded smaller version de Russie .Something decor layout hallways though I can\u9225\u6a9b put finger .I minor problem shower \u9225 ? either shower curtain glass panel keep water spilling place I count figure use I ended making minor flood bathroom I use towels dry .Thankfully I returned room attendants done turn-down service replaced wet towels fresh ones .Although CF felt start like real deluxe experience proved first night .After long day sightseeing area around Palau Nacional I wanted enjoy glass wine Lobby bar heading dinner town .Regretfully private event going time gentleman front desk apologized offered served upstairs library-quite area I happily accepted .Shortly finding place sit I could write postcards waiter appeared take order .When returned informed glass wine \u9225\u6e19n house \u9225 ? could made happier .Very unexpected nice .Skeptics might say small gesture like worth extra Euro 110/night choice accommodation makes difference .I eventually make way lobby bar midnight I enjoyed glass Cava finger foods deserts .The later pricey side I expected pay fine hotel .Although I would stay 1898 I budget constraint I would choose CF hands .You pay get much .This second trip BCN TripAdvisor members warned area become lot touristy 1997 I didn\u9225\u6a9b really find case .Still L\u9225\u6a62ixample far away Placa Catalunya Pasaig de Gracia really nice stroll along \u9225 ? leisurely otherwise .There reason stay Las Ramblas .Even walker Diagonal Metro station two stops form Ramblas .A note caution travel car taxi At 11 AM Monday morning took 30 minutes travel Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas CF .I could walked CF half time I didn\u9225\u6a9b large suitcase .I would also like try Hotel Majestic 2 3 blocks CF many Trip Advisor members spoken highly .But I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b think twice staying CF .I fault experience \u9225 ? well maybe 5 pound room key system REALLY need done away favor keycard \u9225 ? otherwise truly wonderful .I never made breakfastas I saved checkout day ended check 4:30 AM due last minute change travel plans .The reviews TA little bit misleading CF .I noticed lot people gave CF 4-out-of-5 nearly reviews 1998 5-out-of-5 .These reviews coupled uber-cheap rate I originally given CF made originally want avoid .Too often I stayed \u9225\u6e08reat\u9225 ? hotel steep discount regretted .I seriously afraid CF past prime .Thankfully CF everything I expected \u9225 ? actually better b/c surpassed 1898 \u9225 ? truly tough act follow \u9225 ? many ways .But I would explain stellar reviews 1898 gets saying probably exceeds people\u9225\u6a9a expectations 4 star hotel sounds like CF sometimes live people\u9225\u6a9a expectations .I would say CF met expectations every way exceeded certain ways well .The 1898 may better value much much affordably priced offering many similar amenities services .But really comparison .These hotels different vibe \u9225 ? CF decidedly up-market .Of course tourists hotels Americans dollar used .I believe people judging \u9225\u6e02ang buck\u9225 ? \u9225 ? Euro 300 worth closer $ 450 little $ 240 ..whopping 87 % increase 6 years .That small consideration .The CF amongst best Barcelona .I hope eventually stay Majestic may find Hotel Arts point I visited lunch one day felt like I Battery Park City NYC \u9225 ? totally cut rest city .And what\u9225\u6a9a lack restaurant high floor ? How could forget utilize best amenity charge dearly stellar views It must reserved hotel guests less one nights stay cost admission probably one spectacular vistas Mediterranean .And probably want avoid afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225 ? I blame .In meantime Casa Fuster best place sty Barcelona .Hopefully wont take 10 years go back BCN like time ..

33 Do Not Recommend Hotel The room back hotel get natural light outside .The beds sunken impossible sleep .These worst beds seen hotel rating .Concierge presence sporadic reception staff quite helpful .The final bill contained incorrect charges check bills carefully .The hotel overpriced .We stay even though good location ..
34 Very good hotel great location My wife I stayed Dia-Ichi Hotel Tokyo last week July 2006 .I would like echo reviewers mentioned particularly quality hotel great location .The Dai-Ichi Hotel Tokyo across street Shimbashi train station actually underground connection addition couple subway lines also Yamanote JR train line great getting various sights Yamanote line circle line runs around central Tokyo covered JR rail pass .This means coming Narita airport take Narita Express Tokyo Station get Yamanote line travel two stops Shimbashi .In addition great transportation also numerous restaurants coffee shops surrounding streets including full supermarket Shimbashi station .As also mentioned hotel 15 minute walk fish market handy action starts subway begin operation morning .The hotel nice equivalent 4-star business hotel North America well appointed relatively spacious rooms .The staff helpful always seemed least one staff member available time spoke English .We got good price hotel Expedia CAD $ 160/night - price/quality combination would hard pressed match North American hotel .The word caution would directed towards light sleepers hotel next train tracks times noise filter room ..

36 Good Stay Great Views This hotel highly anticipated since booked King Size Balcony Room Top Floor 27th floor The views ca n't beat nice able see Golden Gate way around Bay Bridge .Hotel located 6 blocks Embracadero 1 .25 miles Fisherman 's Wharf .Located one block Pure Chinatown Experience .Room nicely appointed Room 2701 Concierge Lounge access 26th floor .Bathroom little small bed comfortable balcony 2 chairs table nice .Only one minor hiccup rectified quickly without mentioning .Concierge Front Desk Bellman friendly outgoing .Sedan Limo Service available hotel took day trip Monterrey 2 hours away day visit .Never used restaurant since ate time experience real food West Chinatown ..
37 Lovely Room Lovely room attentive staff front desk housekeeping room service .3 nite stay mid-July oh hot truly simply enough pool chairs .Yes looks like photo pool taken photographer back five lounge chairs six arm chairs n't enough hot Saturday afternoon touring city place sit .Otherwise room comfy beds lots towels room amenities replenished room AC works great .
38 Awful - n't stay Two things firstly Fisherman 's Wharf really bad location stay San Francisco - none best restaurants immediate area Fisherman 's Wharf tacky tourist trap even San Fran residents embarassed .Secondly must stay Holiday Inn dire avoided .On arrival given room beach block 5 minute walk reception nowhere near waterfront .The room already occupied someone 's clothes sill room .On second attempt room given dark gloomy little shabby overlooked carpark - albeit large TV clean bathroom .The swimming pool small next main road - worth booking hotel perk .When checked took twenty minute wait reception staff clearly overworked underpaid .Food main eating place Holiday Inn Denny 's - real crime eat chain many excellent one-off places throughout city e .g .Mama 's near Washington Square brunch Tomasso 's North Beach dinner .There nothing depressing walking past load overweight people shovelling processed meat mouths every morning .I guess could n't bothered walk better places none immediate area .In terms location Holiday Inn convenient boats Alcatraz - 's .You better staying Nob Hill/Russian Hill area much closer good restaurants Haight Castro Union Square Golden Gate Park Ferry Building etc .We also stayed Carlton Hotel vacation excellent value - nicely decorated room friendly efficient staff convenient location - importantly - Denny 's .
39 effortless class Only 3 mins stroll scrum Rialto another world calm still .From brass bell massive wrought iron gate open onto small courtyard details public areas rooms impression care attention must personal taste presiding interest owners .Do n't expect fawning service overblown breakfasts - place adults treated .We usually check hotels town future reference - Venice n't bother ..

88 A top choice Barcelona I spent two nights Casa Fuster 26-28 November .I spent two nights Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas checking CF although night Standard room CF 110 Euro night expensive Superior room 1898 CF truly different class 1898 worth extra money .I say however local travel agent quoted rate Euro 240/night inclusive breakfast CF weekend November 17th I ended change travel dates due work .For days I traveled \u9225 ? even though I stay CF weekend \u9225 ? much expensive \u9225 ? Euro 330/night including breakfast .Obviously would great get cheaper rate I would pay higher rate chance stay Casa Fuster service accommodations truly top notch .Let mention I love-hate relationship large hotels .I like hustle bustle crowded lobbies get kind depressed I staying smaller boutique hotels empty-ghost town lobbies .That doesn\u9225\u6a9b mean I fan large numbers tour busses dropping tourists gawk gape wait line afternoon tea .Still second impression CF 1st absolutely stunning building exterior \u9225 ? wow bellhops coming going groups congregating lobby \u9225\u6e18ow real hotel\u9225 ? I would say CF 1898 similar size lobby CF much lively 1898 although high occupancy stay .The 1898 somewhat larger lobby however may account seemed sparkly populated .After check I decided walk around town bit .Of course first thing I noticed I walking back Pasaig de Gracia towards hotel Large grey tour-bus parked outside hotel .Oh well .Guess cant crowded lobby without obligatory tour bus parked outside .Still lobby crowded way I enjoy I fault Although I expected Standard room CF smaller superior room 1898 room CF large luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent bathroom Hotel de Russie Rome .I think bathroom important part hotel room would gladly give extra room real estate would buy larger bathroom .You could comfortably fit two people bathroom I appreciated even though I traveling alone .In fact entire CF reminded smaller version de Russie .Something decor layout hallways though I can\u9225\u6a9b put finger .I minor problem shower \u9225 ? either shower curtain glass panel keep water spilling place I count figure use I ended making minor flood bathroom I use towels dry .Thankfully I returned room attendants done turn-down service replaced wet towels fresh ones .Although CF felt start like real deluxe experience proved first night .After long day sightseeing area around Palau Nacional I wanted enjoy glass wine Lobby bar heading dinner town .Regretfully private event going time gentleman front desk apologized offered served upstairs library-quite area I happily accepted .Shortly finding place sit I could write postcards waiter appeared take order .When returned informed glass wine \u9225\u6e19n house \u9225 ? could made happier .Very unexpected nice .Skeptics might say small gesture like worth extra Euro 110/night choice accommodation makes difference .I eventually make way lobby bar midnight I enjoyed glass Cava finger foods deserts .The later pricey side I expected pay fine hotel .Although I would stay 1898 I budget constraint I would choose CF hands .You pay get much .This second trip BCN TripAdvisor members warned area become lot touristy 1997 I didn\u9225\u6a9b really find case .Still L\u9225\u6a62ixample far away Placa Catalunya Pasaig de Gracia really nice stroll along \u9225 ? leisurely otherwise .There reason stay Las Ramblas .Even walker Diagonal Metro station two stops form Ramblas .A note caution travel car taxi At 11 AM Monday morning took 30 minutes travel Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas CF .I could walked CF half time I didn\u9225\u6a9b large suitcase .I would also like try Hotel Majestic 2 3 blocks CF many Trip Advisor members spoken highly .But I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b think twice staying CF .I fault experience \u9225 ? well maybe 5 pound room key system REALLY need done away favor keycard \u9225 ? otherwise truly wonderful .I never made breakfastas I saved checkout day ended check 4:30 AM due last minute change travel plans .The reviews TA little bit misleading CF .I noticed lot people gave CF 4-out-of-5 nearly reviews 1998 5-out-of-5 .These reviews coupled uber-cheap rate I originally given CF made originally want avoid .Too often I stayed \u9225\u6e08reat\u9225 ? hotel steep discount regretted .I seriously afraid CF past prime .Thankfully CF everything I expected \u9225 ? actually better b/c surpassed 1898 \u9225 ? truly tough act follow \u9225 ? many ways .But I would explain stellar reviews 1898 gets saying probably exceeds people\u9225\u6a9a expectations 4 star hotel sounds like CF sometimes live people\u9225\u6a9a expectations .I would say CF met expectations every way exceeded certain ways well .The 1898 may better value much much affordably priced offering many similar amenities services .But really comparison .These hotels different vibe \u9225 ? CF decidedly up-market .Of course tourists hotels Americans dollar used .I believe people judging \u9225\u6e02ang buck\u9225 ? \u9225 ? Euro 300 worth closer $ 450 little $ 240 ..whopping 87 % increase 6 years .That small consideration .The CF amongst best Barcelona .I hope eventually stay Majestic may find Hotel Arts point I visited lunch one day felt like I Battery Park City NYC \u9225 ? totally cut rest city .And what\u9225\u6a9a lack restaurant high floor ? How could forget utilize best amenity charge dearly stellar views It must reserved hotel guests less one nights stay cost admission probably one spectacular vistas Mediterranean .And probably want avoid afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225 ? I blame .In meantime Casa Fuster best place sty Barcelona .Hopefully wont take 10 years go back BCN like time ..

161 A top choice Barcelona I spent two nights Casa Fuster 26-28 November .I spent two nights Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas checking CF although night Standard room CF 110 Euro night expensive Superior room 1898 CF truly different class 1898 worth extra money .I say however local travel agent quoted rate Euro 240/night inclusive breakfast CF weekend November 17th I ended change travel dates due work .For days I traveled \u9225 ? even though I stay CF weekend \u9225 ? much expensive \u9225 ? Euro 330/night including breakfast .Obviously would great get cheaper rate I would pay higher rate chance stay Casa Fuster service accommodations truly top notch .Let mention I love-hate relationship large hotels .I like hustle bustle crowded lobbies get kind depressed I staying smaller boutique hotels empty-ghost town lobbies .That doesn\u9225\u6a9b mean I fan large numbers tour busses dropping tourists gawk gape wait line afternoon tea .Still second impression CF 1st absolutely stunning building exterior \u9225 ? wow bellhops coming going groups congregating lobby \u9225\u6e18ow real hotel\u9225 ? I would say CF 1898 similar size lobby CF much lively 1898 although high occupancy stay .The 1898 somewhat larger lobby however may account seemed sparkly populated .After check I decided walk around town bit .Of course first thing I noticed I walking back Pasaig de Gracia towards hotel Large grey tour-bus parked outside hotel .Oh well .Guess cant crowded lobby without obligatory tour bus parked outside .Still lobby crowded way I enjoy I fault Although I expected Standard room CF smaller superior room 1898 room CF large luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent bathroom Hotel de Russie Rome .I think bathroom important part hotel room would gladly give extra room real estate would buy larger bathroom .You could comfortably fit two people bathroom I appreciated even though I traveling alone .In fact entire CF reminded smaller version de Russie .Something decor layout hallways though I can\u9225\u6a9b put finger .I minor problem shower \u9225 ? either shower curtain glass panel keep water spilling place I count figure use I ended making minor flood bathroom I use towels dry .Thankfully I returned room attendants done turn-down service replaced wet towels fresh ones .Although CF felt start like real deluxe experience proved first night .After long day sightseeing area around Palau Nacional I wanted enjoy glass wine Lobby bar heading dinner town .Regretfully private event going time gentleman front desk apologized offered served upstairs library-quite area I happily accepted .Shortly finding place sit I could write postcards waiter appeared take order .When returned informed glass wine \u9225\u6e19n house \u9225 ? could made happier .Very unexpected nice .Skeptics might say small gesture like worth extra Euro 110/night choice accommodation makes difference .I eventually make way lobby bar midnight I enjoyed glass Cava finger foods deserts .The later pricey side I expected pay fine hotel .Although I would stay 1898 I budget constraint I would choose CF hands .You pay get much .This second trip BCN TripAdvisor members warned area become lot touristy 1997 I didn\u9225\u6a9b really find case .Still L\u9225\u6a62ixample far away Placa Catalunya Pasaig de Gracia really nice stroll along \u9225 ? leisurely otherwise .There reason stay Las Ramblas .Even walker Diagonal Metro station two stops form Ramblas .A note caution travel car taxi At 11 AM Monday morning took 30 minutes travel Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas CF .I could walked CF half time I didn\u9225\u6a9b large suitcase .I would also like try Hotel Majestic 2 3 blocks CF many Trip Advisor members spoken highly .But I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b think twice staying CF .I fault experience \u9225 ? well maybe 5 pound room key system REALLY need done away favor keycard \u9225 ? otherwise truly wonderful .I never made breakfastas I saved checkout day ended check 4:30 AM due last minute change travel plans .The reviews TA little bit misleading CF .I noticed lot people gave CF 4-out-of-5 nearly reviews 1998 5-out-of-5 .These reviews coupled uber-cheap rate I originally given CF made originally want avoid .Too often I stayed \u9225\u6e08reat\u9225 ? hotel steep discount regretted .I seriously afraid CF past prime .Thankfully CF everything I expected \u9225 ? actually better b/c surpassed 1898 \u9225 ? truly tough act follow \u9225 ? many ways .But I would explain stellar reviews 1898 gets saying probably exceeds people\u9225\u6a9a expectations 4 star hotel sounds like CF sometimes live people\u9225\u6a9a expectations .I would say CF met expectations every way exceeded certain ways well .The 1898 may better value much much affordably priced offering many similar amenities services .But really comparison .These hotels different vibe \u9225 ? CF decidedly up-market .Of course tourists hotels Americans dollar used .I believe people judging \u9225\u6e02ang buck\u9225 ? \u9225 ? Euro 300 worth closer $ 450 little $ 240 ..whopping 87 % increase 6 years .That small consideration .The CF amongst best Barcelona .I hope eventually stay Majestic may find Hotel Arts point I visited lunch one day felt like I Battery Park City NYC \u9225 ? totally cut rest city .And what\u9225\u6a9a lack restaurant high floor ? How could forget utilize best amenity charge dearly stellar views It must reserved hotel guests less one nights stay cost admission probably one spectacular vistas Mediterranean .And probably want avoid afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225 ? I blame .In meantime Casa Fuster best place sty Barcelona .Hopefully wont take 10 years go back BCN like time ..
