15 A top choice Barcelona , I spent two night Casa Fuster 26-28 November .I spent two night Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas checking CF , although night Standard room CF 110 Euro night expensive Superior room 1898 , CF truly different class 1898 worth extra money .I say however local travel agent quoted rate Euro 240/night inclusive breakfast CF weekend November 17th , I ended change travel date due work .For day I traveled \u9225 ? , even though I stay CF weekend \u9225 ? , much expensive \u9225 ? , Euro 330/night including breakfast .Obviously , would great get cheaper rate , I would pay higher rate chance stay Casa Fuster service accommodation truly top notch .Let mention I love-hate relationship large hotel .I like hustle bustle crowded lobby get kind depressed I staying smaller boutique hotel empty-ghost town lobby .That doesn\u9225\u6a9b mean I fan large number tour bus dropping tourist gawk gape wait line afternoon tea .Still , second impression CF 1st absolutely stunning building exterior \u9225 ? , wow , bellhop coming going group congregating lobby \u9225\u6e18ow real hotel\u9225 ? , I would say CF 1898 similar size , lobby CF much lively 1898 although high occupancy stay .The 1898 somewhat larger lobby however may account seemed sparkly populated .After check I decided walk around town bit .Of course , first thing I noticed I walking back Pasaig de Gracia towards hotel Large grey tour-bus parked outside hotel .Oh well .Guess cant crowded lobby without obligatory tour bus parked outside .Still , lobby crowded way I enjoy I fault Although I expected Standard room CF smaller superior room 1898 , room CF , large , luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent bathroom Hotel de Russie Rome .I think bathroom important part hotel room would gladly give extra room real estate would buy larger bathroom .You could comfortably fit two people bathroom I appreciated even though I traveling alone .In fact entire CF reminded smaller version de Russie .Something decor , layout hallway though I can\u9225\u6a9b put finger .I minor problem shower \u9225 ? , either shower curtain glass panel keep water spilling place , I count figure use , I ended making minor flood bathroom I use towel dry .Thankfully I returned room attendant done turn-down service replaced wet towel fresh one .Although CF felt start like real deluxe experience , proved first night .After long day sightseeing area around Palau Nacional I wanted enjoy glass wine Lobby bar heading dinner town .Regretfully , private event going time gentleman front desk apologized offered served upstairs library-quite area I happily accepted .Shortly finding place sit I could write postcard waiter appeared take order .When returned informed glass wine \u9225\u6e19n house , \u9225 ? , could made happier .Very unexpected , nice .Skeptics might say small gesture like worth extra Euro 110/night choice accommodation , make difference .I eventually make way lobby bar midnight I enjoyed glass Cava , finger food , desert .The later pricey side I expected pay fine hotel .Although I would stay 1898 , I budget constraint I would choose CF hand .You pay , get much .This second trip BCN TripAdvisor member warned area become lot touristy 1997 , I didn\u9225\u6a9b really find case .Still , L\u9225\u6a62ixample far away Placa Catalunya Pasaig de Gracia really nice stroll along \u9225 ? , leisurely otherwise .There reason stay Las Ramblas .Even walker , Diagonal Metro station two stop form Ramblas .A note caution travel car taxi At 11 AM Monday morning took 30 minute travel Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas CF .I could walked CF half time I didn\u9225\u6a9b large suitcase .I would also like try Hotel Majestic , 2 3 block CF many Trip Advisor member spoken highly .But I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b think twice staying CF .I fault experience \u9225 ? , well maybe 5 pound room key system REALLY need done away favor keycard \u9225 ? , otherwise truly wonderful .I never made breakfastas I saved checkout day ended check 4:30 AM due last minute change travel plan .The review TA little bit misleading CF .I noticed lot people gave CF 4-out-of-5 nearly review 1998 5-out-of-5 .These review , coupled uber-cheap rate I originally given CF , made originally want avoid .Too often I stayed \u9225\u6e08reat\u9225 ? , hotel steep discount regretted .I seriously afraid CF past prime .Thankfully CF everything I expected \u9225 ? , actually better b/c surpassed 1898 \u9225 ? , truly tough act follow \u9225 ? , many way .But I would explain stellar review 1898 get saying probably exceeds people\u9225\u6a9a expectation 4 star hotel sound like CF sometimes live people\u9225\u6a9a expectation .I would say CF met expectation every way exceeded certain way well .The 1898 may better value much , much affordably priced offering many similar amenity service .But really comparison .These hotel different vibe \u9225 ? , CF decidedly up-market .Of course tourist hotel Americans dollar used .I believe people judging \u9225\u6e02ang buck\u9225 ? \u9225 ? , Euro 300 worth closer $ 450 little $ 240 ..whopping 87 % increase 6 year .That small consideration .The CF amongst best Barcelona .I hope eventually stay Majestic may find Hotel Arts point , I visited lunch one day felt like I Battery Park City , NYC \u9225 ? , totally cut rest city .And what\u9225\u6a9a lack restaurant high floor ? , How could forget utilize best amenity , charge dearly stellar view , It must reserved hotel guest le one night stay cost admission probably one spectacular vista Mediterranean .And probably want avoid afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225 ? , I blame .In meantime , Casa Fuster best place sty Barcelona .Hopefully wont take 10 year go back BCN like time ..

88 A top choice Barcelona , I spent two night Casa Fuster 26-28 November .I spent two night Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas checking CF , although night Standard room CF 110 Euro night expensive Superior room 1898 , CF truly different class 1898 worth extra money .I say however local travel agent quoted rate Euro 240/night inclusive breakfast CF weekend November 17th , I ended change travel date due work .For day I traveled \u9225 ? , even though I stay CF weekend \u9225 ? , much expensive \u9225 ? , Euro 330/night including breakfast .Obviously , would great get cheaper rate , I would pay higher rate chance stay Casa Fuster service accommodation truly top notch .Let mention I love-hate relationship large hotel .I like hustle bustle crowded lobby get kind depressed I staying smaller boutique hotel empty-ghost town lobby .That doesn\u9225\u6a9b mean I fan large number tour bus dropping tourist gawk gape wait line afternoon tea .Still , second impression CF 1st absolutely stunning building exterior \u9225 ? , wow , bellhop coming going group congregating lobby \u9225\u6e18ow real hotel\u9225 ? , I would say CF 1898 similar size , lobby CF much lively 1898 although high occupancy stay .The 1898 somewhat larger lobby however may account seemed sparkly populated .After check I decided walk around town bit .Of course , first thing I noticed I walking back Pasaig de Gracia towards hotel Large grey tour-bus parked outside hotel .Oh well .Guess cant crowded lobby without obligatory tour bus parked outside .Still , lobby crowded way I enjoy I fault Although I expected Standard room CF smaller superior room 1898 , room CF , large , luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent bathroom Hotel de Russie Rome .I think bathroom important part hotel room would gladly give extra room real estate would buy larger bathroom .You could comfortably fit two people bathroom I appreciated even though I traveling alone .In fact entire CF reminded smaller version de Russie .Something decor , layout hallway though I can\u9225\u6a9b put finger .I minor problem shower \u9225 ? , either shower curtain glass panel keep water spilling place , I count figure use , I ended making minor flood bathroom I use towel dry .Thankfully I returned room attendant done turn-down service replaced wet towel fresh one .Although CF felt start like real deluxe experience , proved first night .After long day sightseeing area around Palau Nacional I wanted enjoy glass wine Lobby bar heading dinner town .Regretfully , private event going time gentleman front desk apologized offered served upstairs library-quite area I happily accepted .Shortly finding place sit I could write postcard waiter appeared take order .When returned informed glass wine \u9225\u6e19n house , \u9225 ? , could made happier .Very unexpected , nice .Skeptics might say small gesture like worth extra Euro 110/night choice accommodation , make difference .I eventually make way lobby bar midnight I enjoyed glass Cava , finger food , desert .The later pricey side I expected pay fine hotel .Although I would stay 1898 , I budget constraint I would choose CF hand .You pay , get much .This second trip BCN TripAdvisor member warned area become lot touristy 1997 , I didn\u9225\u6a9b really find case .Still , L\u9225\u6a62ixample far away Placa Catalunya Pasaig de Gracia really nice stroll along \u9225 ? , leisurely otherwise .There reason stay Las Ramblas .Even walker , Diagonal Metro station two stop form Ramblas .A note caution travel car taxi At 11 AM Monday morning took 30 minute travel Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas CF .I could walked CF half time I didn\u9225\u6a9b large suitcase .I would also like try Hotel Majestic , 2 3 block CF many Trip Advisor member spoken highly .But I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b think twice staying CF .I fault experience \u9225 ? , well maybe 5 pound room key system REALLY need done away favor keycard \u9225 ? , otherwise truly wonderful .I never made breakfastas I saved checkout day ended check 4:30 AM due last minute change travel plan .The review TA little bit misleading CF .I noticed lot people gave CF 4-out-of-5 nearly review 1998 5-out-of-5 .These review , coupled uber-cheap rate I originally given CF , made originally want avoid .Too often I stayed \u9225\u6e08reat\u9225 ? , hotel steep discount regretted .I seriously afraid CF past prime .Thankfully CF everything I expected \u9225 ? , actually better b/c surpassed 1898 \u9225 ? , truly tough act follow \u9225 ? , many way .But I would explain stellar review 1898 get saying probably exceeds people\u9225\u6a9a expectation 4 star hotel sound like CF sometimes live people\u9225\u6a9a expectation .I would say CF met expectation every way exceeded certain way well .The 1898 may better value much , much affordably priced offering many similar amenity service .But really comparison .These hotel different vibe \u9225 ? , CF decidedly up-market .Of course tourist hotel Americans dollar used .I believe people judging \u9225\u6e02ang buck\u9225 ? \u9225 ? , Euro 300 worth closer $ 450 little $ 240 ..whopping 87 % increase 6 year .That small consideration .The CF amongst best Barcelona .I hope eventually stay Majestic may find Hotel Arts point , I visited lunch one day felt like I Battery Park City , NYC \u9225 ? , totally cut rest city .And what\u9225\u6a9a lack restaurant high floor ? , How could forget utilize best amenity , charge dearly stellar view , It must reserved hotel guest le one night stay cost admission probably one spectacular vista Mediterranean .And probably want avoid afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225 ? , I blame .In meantime , Casa Fuster best place sty Barcelona .Hopefully wont take 10 year go back BCN like time ..

161 A top choice Barcelona , I spent two night Casa Fuster 26-28 November .I spent two night Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas checking CF , although night Standard room CF 110 Euro night expensive Superior room 1898 , CF truly different class 1898 worth extra money .I say however local travel agent quoted rate Euro 240/night inclusive breakfast CF weekend November 17th , I ended change travel date due work .For day I traveled \u9225 ? , even though I stay CF weekend \u9225 ? , much expensive \u9225 ? , Euro 330/night including breakfast .Obviously , would great get cheaper rate , I would pay higher rate chance stay Casa Fuster service accommodation truly top notch .Let mention I love-hate relationship large hotel .I like hustle bustle crowded lobby get kind depressed I staying smaller boutique hotel empty-ghost town lobby .That doesn\u9225\u6a9b mean I fan large number tour bus dropping tourist gawk gape wait line afternoon tea .Still , second impression CF 1st absolutely stunning building exterior \u9225 ? , wow , bellhop coming going group congregating lobby \u9225\u6e18ow real hotel\u9225 ? , I would say CF 1898 similar size , lobby CF much lively 1898 although high occupancy stay .The 1898 somewhat larger lobby however may account seemed sparkly populated .After check I decided walk around town bit .Of course , first thing I noticed I walking back Pasaig de Gracia towards hotel Large grey tour-bus parked outside hotel .Oh well .Guess cant crowded lobby without obligatory tour bus parked outside .Still , lobby crowded way I enjoy I fault Although I expected Standard room CF smaller superior room 1898 , room CF , large , luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent bathroom Hotel de Russie Rome .I think bathroom important part hotel room would gladly give extra room real estate would buy larger bathroom .You could comfortably fit two people bathroom I appreciated even though I traveling alone .In fact entire CF reminded smaller version de Russie .Something decor , layout hallway though I can\u9225\u6a9b put finger .I minor problem shower \u9225 ? , either shower curtain glass panel keep water spilling place , I count figure use , I ended making minor flood bathroom I use towel dry .Thankfully I returned room attendant done turn-down service replaced wet towel fresh one .Although CF felt start like real deluxe experience , proved first night .After long day sightseeing area around Palau Nacional I wanted enjoy glass wine Lobby bar heading dinner town .Regretfully , private event going time gentleman front desk apologized offered served upstairs library-quite area I happily accepted .Shortly finding place sit I could write postcard waiter appeared take order .When returned informed glass wine \u9225\u6e19n house , \u9225 ? , could made happier .Very unexpected , nice .Skeptics might say small gesture like worth extra Euro 110/night choice accommodation , make difference .I eventually make way lobby bar midnight I enjoyed glass Cava , finger food , desert .The later pricey side I expected pay fine hotel .Although I would stay 1898 , I budget constraint I would choose CF hand .You pay , get much .This second trip BCN TripAdvisor member warned area become lot touristy 1997 , I didn\u9225\u6a9b really find case .Still , L\u9225\u6a62ixample far away Placa Catalunya Pasaig de Gracia really nice stroll along \u9225 ? , leisurely otherwise .There reason stay Las Ramblas .Even walker , Diagonal Metro station two stop form Ramblas .A note caution travel car taxi At 11 AM Monday morning took 30 minute travel Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas CF .I could walked CF half time I didn\u9225\u6a9b large suitcase .I would also like try Hotel Majestic , 2 3 block CF many Trip Advisor member spoken highly .But I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b think twice staying CF .I fault experience \u9225 ? , well maybe 5 pound room key system REALLY need done away favor keycard \u9225 ? , otherwise truly wonderful .I never made breakfastas I saved checkout day ended check 4:30 AM due last minute change travel plan .The review TA little bit misleading CF .I noticed lot people gave CF 4-out-of-5 nearly review 1998 5-out-of-5 .These review , coupled uber-cheap rate I originally given CF , made originally want avoid .Too often I stayed \u9225\u6e08reat\u9225 ? , hotel steep discount regretted .I seriously afraid CF past prime .Thankfully CF everything I expected \u9225 ? , actually better b/c surpassed 1898 \u9225 ? , truly tough act follow \u9225 ? , many way .But I would explain stellar review 1898 get saying probably exceeds people\u9225\u6a9a expectation 4 star hotel sound like CF sometimes live people\u9225\u6a9a expectation .I would say CF met expectation every way exceeded certain way well .The 1898 may better value much , much affordably priced offering many similar amenity service .But really comparison .These hotel different vibe \u9225 ? , CF decidedly up-market .Of course tourist hotel Americans dollar used .I believe people judging \u9225\u6e02ang buck\u9225 ? \u9225 ? , Euro 300 worth closer $ 450 little $ 240 ..whopping 87 % increase 6 year .That small consideration .The CF amongst best Barcelona .I hope eventually stay Majestic may find Hotel Arts point , I visited lunch one day felt like I Battery Park City , NYC \u9225 ? , totally cut rest city .And what\u9225\u6a9a lack restaurant high floor ? , How could forget utilize best amenity , charge dearly stellar view , It must reserved hotel guest le one night stay cost admission probably one spectacular vista Mediterranean .And probably want avoid afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225 ? , I blame .In meantime , Casa Fuster best place sty Barcelona .Hopefully wont take 10 year go back BCN like time ..
