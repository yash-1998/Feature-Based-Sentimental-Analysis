5 Extremely friendly place , We stayed two-bedroom villa Ixora found place comfortable , perfectly maintained relaxing .The staff friendly 'd find anywhere , German owner always accommodating friendly - giving us itinerary booking driver day trip , well offering us lift town whenever wanted .Some people tripadvisor stated villas 'out sticks ' , seems little churlish transport dirt cheap 're really far anything .If clubbing Legian thing , fair enough , may 're - 're relaxing holiday take island pace , could much worse stay ..

10 Great modern hotel away action Barcelona , Great hotel business conventions part reason trip , far life city .In nutshell , hotel amenities fine , staff friendly helpful , restaurant good rooms comfortable .A spa/restaurant/pool 13th floor nice , although I got bit tired Hollywood theme songs played somewhat annoying volumes .All rooms view either ocean city .The complaint I location .The Diagonal Mar area around hotel one Barcelona 's interventions urban renewal project .Nearby shopping mall indistinuishable malls anywhere around world .I would recommend tappas bar far east end terrassa , explore sidewalk cafes north mall .Access city bus 41 35 mins Pl .Catalunya , yellow metro line 15 mins Jaume station near Barri Gotic , tram takes Olympic Village via Pl .Glories 15 mins .Taxi access good , located outside hotel ..
11 Excellent Traveling Location , We booked trip Japan Japanese travel agency hotel part package deal .It good location near Shinjuku station , one major subway JR line stops .There also free shuttle station , helped though walk n't bad .The hotel seems litle nicer standard Hilton hotels US .We stayed twice - days arrived days headed home .Service great used concierge service numerous times find good restaurants around area .It 's hit miss staff speaking English , although part understood us .We ate breakfast hotel , Japanese Western style buffet excellent .However , skipped eating restaurants second floor bit pricey .If Tokyo city 're visiting I 'd probably recommend different hotel Shinjuku business district pretty quiet night unless hang station shuttle service ends around 9:30PM .If Tokyo one many cities agenda , I thought great choice .Only downside JR Kyoto/Osaka leaves Tokyo station , change stations venture west .I strongly recomend getting JR pass ..
12 Best Hotel , NY - PERIOD .WOW , Perfect location , friendly staff , good rate St Patrick 's Day weekend .$ 220 everything included .The room bigger first apartment - I challenge find room bigger $ 1,000 .New , sleek , modern COMFORTABLE furniture .An actual working fireplace room , I n't know let guests use .Charming chair reading lamp beautiful .The windows overlooked playground courtyard , almost silent stay .We right next elevator , n't hear thing .Big flat panel TV , plus DVD/VCR unit .The sitting area really comfy couch I slept w/o problems I 5 feet /152cm tall , fridge room food .The bathroom HUGE - probably 8x11ft/ 2 .4m x 16 .7m ? , also window could open .It nice get real fresh air , noisy , useless fan .The drawback complimentary breakfast ended like 9am .It go 11 least , US hotels end 9 .Boooh .Anyway , I say enough good things hotel .It far better Waldorf Sheraton every way ..
13 Needs Updating Arrived late flight walked room heart sank .It terrible , Poky small .Bathroom tiny dirty sink .I asked non smoking room room smelt faintly smoke .Bed nice although smell tabacco wafted nose trying sleep .There room put 3 suitcases .We walk around .The balcony/lanai frightened ...old I wondered much rust covered paint , I might fall I lent bars , I 2 room upgrade , I would n't liked stayed original room ...would far worse experience I .I 'd give 3 4 10 , Looks nothing like picture brochures , For value money , Royal Hawaiian , Moama Surf Sheraton might approx $ 100 per night dearer , getting $ 400 value .Worth extra money .
14 I Had Great Experience , I little worried I read recent reviews hotel .I 'm glad I chose stay Singel , The desk clerk joked I smallest room Amsterdam probably right suited needs perfectly clean , quiet room amenities shower , TV w/cable .I requested non-smoking room room bright , modern , airy smoke-free , The location fabulous - near Centraal Station quiet canal virtually city center close western side town great shops restaurants .Breakfast Singel included array meats , cheeses , fruit , toasts , yogurt , granola , juice .Each table gets carafe coffee/tea .Friendly service - yes leave room key common Europe Would I stay ? Yes .
15 A top choice Barcelona , I spent two nights Casa Fuster 26-28 November .I spent two nights Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas checking CF , although night Standard room CF 110 Euro night expensive Superior room 1898 , CF truly different class 1898 worth extra money .I say however local travel agent quoted rate Euro 240/night inclusive breakfast CF weekend November 17th , I ended change travel dates due work .For days I traveled \u9225 ? , even though I stay CF weekend \u9225 ? , much expensive \u9225 ? , Euro 330/night including breakfast .Obviously , would great get cheaper rate , I would pay higher rate chance stay Casa Fuster service accommodations truly top notch .Let mention I love-hate relationship large hotels .I like hustle bustle crowded lobbies get kind depressed I staying smaller boutique hotels empty-ghost town lobbies .That doesn\u9225\u6a9b mean I fan large numbers tour busses dropping tourists gawk gape wait line afternoon tea .Still , second impression CF 1st absolutely stunning building exterior \u9225 ? , wow , bellhops coming going groups congregating lobby \u9225\u6e18ow real hotel\u9225 ? , I would say CF 1898 similar size , lobby CF much lively 1898 although high occupancy stay .The 1898 somewhat larger lobby however may account seemed sparkly populated .After check I decided walk around town bit .Of course , first thing I noticed I walking back Pasaig de Gracia towards hotel Large grey tour-bus parked outside hotel .Oh well .Guess cant crowded lobby without obligatory tour bus parked outside .Still , lobby crowded way I enjoy I fault Although I expected Standard room CF smaller superior room 1898 , room CF , large , luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent bathroom Hotel de Russie Rome .I think bathroom important part hotel room would gladly give extra room real estate would buy larger bathroom .You could comfortably fit two people bathroom I appreciated even though I traveling alone .In fact entire CF reminded smaller version de Russie .Something decor , layout hallways though I can\u9225\u6a9b put finger .I minor problem shower \u9225 ? , either shower curtain glass panel keep water spilling place , I count figure use , I ended making minor flood bathroom I use towels dry .Thankfully I returned room attendants done turn-down service replaced wet towels fresh ones .Although CF felt start like real deluxe experience , proved first night .After long day sightseeing area around Palau Nacional I wanted enjoy glass wine Lobby bar heading dinner town .Regretfully , private event going time gentleman front desk apologized offered served upstairs library-quite area I happily accepted .Shortly finding place sit I could write postcards waiter appeared take order .When returned informed glass wine \u9225\u6e19n house , \u9225 ? , could made happier .Very unexpected , nice .Skeptics might say small gesture like worth extra Euro 110/night choice accommodation , makes difference .I eventually make way lobby bar midnight I enjoyed glass Cava , finger foods , deserts .The later pricey side I expected pay fine hotel .Although I would stay 1898 , I budget constraint I would choose CF hands .You pay , get much .This second trip BCN TripAdvisor members warned area become lot touristy 1997 , I didn\u9225\u6a9b really find case .Still , L\u9225\u6a62ixample far away Placa Catalunya Pasaig de Gracia really nice stroll along \u9225 ? , leisurely otherwise .There reason stay Las Ramblas .Even walker , Diagonal Metro station two stops form Ramblas .A note caution travel car taxi At 11 AM Monday morning took 30 minutes travel Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas CF .I could walked CF half time I didn\u9225\u6a9b large suitcase .I would also like try Hotel Majestic , 2 3 blocks CF many Trip Advisor members spoken highly .But I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b think twice staying CF .I fault experience \u9225 ? , well maybe 5 pound room key system REALLY need done away favor keycard \u9225 ? , otherwise truly wonderful .I never made breakfastas I saved checkout day ended check 4:30 AM due last minute change travel plans .The reviews TA little bit misleading CF .I noticed lot people gave CF 4-out-of-5 nearly reviews 1998 5-out-of-5 .These reviews , coupled uber-cheap rate I originally given CF , made originally want avoid .Too often I stayed \u9225\u6e08reat\u9225 ? , hotel steep discount regretted .I seriously afraid CF past prime .Thankfully CF everything I expected \u9225 ? , actually better b/c surpassed 1898 \u9225 ? , truly tough act follow \u9225 ? , many ways .But I would explain stellar reviews 1898 gets saying probably exceeds people\u9225\u6a9a expectations 4 star hotel sounds like CF sometimes live people\u9225\u6a9a expectations .I would say CF met expectations every way exceeded certain ways well .The 1898 may better value much , much affordably priced offering many similar amenities services .But really comparison .These hotels different vibe \u9225 ? , CF decidedly up-market .Of course tourists hotels Americans dollar used .I believe people judging \u9225\u6e02ang buck\u9225 ? \u9225 ? , Euro 300 worth closer $ 450 little $ 240 ..whopping 87 % increase 6 years .That small consideration .The CF amongst best Barcelona .I hope eventually stay Majestic may find Hotel Arts point , I visited lunch one day felt like I Battery Park City , NYC \u9225 ? , totally cut rest city .And what\u9225\u6a9a lack restaurant high floor ? , How could forget utilize best amenity , charge dearly stellar views , It must reserved hotel guests less one nights stay cost admission probably one spectacular vistas Mediterranean .And probably want avoid afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225 ? , I blame .In meantime , Casa Fuster best place sty Barcelona .Hopefully wont take 10 years go back BCN like time ..

20 Very Expensive Area ,Not great , quite walk Dam Square Central Station I would n't want cases .This hotel situated major noisy roadParking I lead believe would free ......'ll pay E25 per day ...I n't convinced security car .Customer Service Friendly particularly helpful , equal average hostel .Breakfast Actually , bad , I enjoyed even though I feel though I waas sitting chinese resturant , odd .Rooms It seemed crammed many beds room possible , I 4 single beds room , I idea , I taveling alone .I comment sheets though , comfortable ...felt soft baby 's arse .I slept well .Decor Left LOT desired , painting carpeting shoddy heavily used , looked like owner got couple mates maintenance taken ride , place seriously feels like low budget motel , high star rated price .I n't dare us ethe shower fear contracting nasty fungal growth , bathroom unacceptably dirty light n't work I would n't stay , much better professional places price .

31 perfect , I heard hotel friend , , I Boston last August , I choose Westin Waterfront .The hotel seemed big business hotel convention center next door , looking carefuly , lot families staying .Staff professionnal smily bellman , front desk housekeeping .Very lighty lobby nice atrium wooden natural materials everywhere .I comfortable room great view Downtown Boston , huge bathroom , fabulous sleeping heavenly beds , specific Westin , also coffee maker Starbucks room .There fitness center nice indoor pool , appreciated walked town whole day , I visiting friends Cambridge opposite side town , taxi drive 15minutes costs around $ 17/way .Downtown Historic Boston 5-7 minute taxi drive , costs $ 8/way .I breakfast buffet restaurant Sauciety , simply delicious , So even Westin situated south Boston said , ,I would definitely go back recommand anybody ..

33 Do Not Recommend Hotel , The room back hotel get natural light outside .The beds sunken impossible sleep .These worst beds seen hotel rating .Concierge presence sporadic reception staff quite helpful .The final bill contained incorrect charges , check bills carefully .The hotel overpriced .We stay even though good location ..
34 Very good hotel great location , My wife I stayed Dia-Ichi Hotel Tokyo last week July 2006 .I would like echo reviewers mentioned , particularly quality hotel great location .The Dai-Ichi Hotel Tokyo across street Shimbashi train station actually underground connection , addition couple subway lines also Yamanote JR train line great getting various sights Yamanote line circle line runs around central Tokyo covered JR rail pass .This means coming Narita airport take Narita Express Tokyo Station get Yamanote line travel two stops Shimbashi .In addition great transportation , also numerous restaurants coffee shops surrounding streets , including full supermarket Shimbashi station .As also mentioned , hotel 15 minute walk fish market handy action starts subway begin operation morning .The hotel nice equivalent 4-star business hotel North America well appointed relatively spacious rooms .The staff helpful always seemed least one staff member available time spoke English .We got good price hotel Expedia CAD $ 160/night - price/quality combination would hard pressed match North American hotel .The word caution would directed towards light sleepers hotel next train tracks times noise filter room ..
35 Yup , It 's , Ritz except fitness center Have stayed Ritz/Four Seasons properties several cities one followed line prompt service , individualized welcome card upon check-in I need kind thing , clean , comfortable room beds - requisite Ferraris , Porshes Escalades parked front center valet .We ton luggage including musical equipment , bellhops attentive luggage room less 10 mins check-in .Was little disappointed fitness center - along lines something 'd find Hyatt , still decent .Close shops , etc .Still ticks Ritz 4/5 star hotels charge extra $ 10 internet access , guess expensing business accounts anyway , include room rate - I get free access Best Westerns , Overall , 'll definitely know 's Ritz ..
36 Good Stay Great Views , This hotel highly anticipated since booked King Size Balcony Room Top Floor 27th floor The views ca n't beat , nice able see Golden Gate way around Bay Bridge .Hotel located 6 blocks Embracadero 1 .25 miles Fisherman 's Wharf .Located one block Pure Chinatown Experience .Room nicely appointed Room 2701 Concierge Lounge access 26th floor .Bathroom little small bed comfortable balcony 2 chairs table nice .Only one minor hiccup rectified quickly without mentioning .Concierge Front Desk Bellman friendly outgoing .Sedan Limo Service available hotel took day trip Monterrey 2 hours away day visit .Never used restaurant , since ate time experience real food West Chinatown ..
37 Lovely Room Lovely room , attentive staff front desk housekeeping room service .3 nite stay mid-July oh hot truly simply enough pool chairs .Yes looks like photo pool taken photographer back , five lounge chairs six arm chairs n't enough hot Saturday afternoon touring city , place sit .Otherwise , room comfy beds , lots towels , room amenities replenished room AC works great .
38 Awful - n't stay , Two things firstly , Fisherman 's Wharf really bad location stay , San Francisco - none best restaurants immediate area , Fisherman 's Wharf tacky tourist trap even San Fran residents embarassed .Secondly , must stay , Holiday Inn dire avoided .On arrival , given room beach block 5 minute walk reception nowhere near waterfront .The room already occupied someone 's clothes sill room .On second attempt , room given dark , gloomy , little shabby overlooked carpark - albeit large TV clean bathroom .The swimming pool small next main road - worth booking hotel perk .When checked , took twenty minute wait reception staff clearly overworked underpaid .Food main eating place Holiday Inn Denny 's - real crime eat chain many excellent one-off places throughout city e .g .Mama 's near Washington Square brunch , Tomasso 's North Beach dinner .There nothing depressing walking past load overweight people shovelling processed meat mouths every morning .I guess could n't bothered walk better places , none immediate area .In terms location , Holiday Inn convenient boats Alcatraz - 's .You better staying Nob Hill/Russian Hill area much closer good restaurants , Haight , Castro , Union Square , Golden Gate Park , Ferry Building etc .We also stayed Carlton Hotel vacation , excellent value - nicely decorated room , friendly efficient staff , convenient location - importantly - Denny 's .
39 effortless class Only 3 mins stroll scrum , Rialto , another world , calm still .From brass bell massive wrought iron gate open onto small courtyard , details public areas rooms , impression care attention must personal taste presiding interest owners .Do n't expect fawning service overblown breakfasts - place adults treated .We usually check hotels town future reference - Venice n't bother ..
40 Worst place stay Barcelona , I\u9e93ve Barcelona many times , usually stay city center time I decided try newly builded Hotel .Big mistake .Altought Hotel nice , staff higly unattentive unpolite .Specially front house staff extremly unhelpful .Breakfeast good either .I dont know haw claim four star hotel .The good point one city knows Hotel , therefore want take taxi give directions .I wouldnt recommend place ..
41 Awesome Location Definately recommend place .I stayed great time .The location unbeatable , short ferry trip city fantastic walks close .The room met needs breakfast great inclusion .I definately stay , next time I try King Spa suite ..

88 A top choice Barcelona , I spent two nights Casa Fuster 26-28 November .I spent two nights Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas checking CF , although night Standard room CF 110 Euro night expensive Superior room 1898 , CF truly different class 1898 worth extra money .I say however local travel agent quoted rate Euro 240/night inclusive breakfast CF weekend November 17th , I ended change travel dates due work .For days I traveled \u9225 ? , even though I stay CF weekend \u9225 ? , much expensive \u9225 ? , Euro 330/night including breakfast .Obviously , would great get cheaper rate , I would pay higher rate chance stay Casa Fuster service accommodations truly top notch .Let mention I love-hate relationship large hotels .I like hustle bustle crowded lobbies get kind depressed I staying smaller boutique hotels empty-ghost town lobbies .That doesn\u9225\u6a9b mean I fan large numbers tour busses dropping tourists gawk gape wait line afternoon tea .Still , second impression CF 1st absolutely stunning building exterior \u9225 ? , wow , bellhops coming going groups congregating lobby \u9225\u6e18ow real hotel\u9225 ? , I would say CF 1898 similar size , lobby CF much lively 1898 although high occupancy stay .The 1898 somewhat larger lobby however may account seemed sparkly populated .After check I decided walk around town bit .Of course , first thing I noticed I walking back Pasaig de Gracia towards hotel Large grey tour-bus parked outside hotel .Oh well .Guess cant crowded lobby without obligatory tour bus parked outside .Still , lobby crowded way I enjoy I fault Although I expected Standard room CF smaller superior room 1898 , room CF , large , luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent bathroom Hotel de Russie Rome .I think bathroom important part hotel room would gladly give extra room real estate would buy larger bathroom .You could comfortably fit two people bathroom I appreciated even though I traveling alone .In fact entire CF reminded smaller version de Russie .Something decor , layout hallways though I can\u9225\u6a9b put finger .I minor problem shower \u9225 ? , either shower curtain glass panel keep water spilling place , I count figure use , I ended making minor flood bathroom I use towels dry .Thankfully I returned room attendants done turn-down service replaced wet towels fresh ones .Although CF felt start like real deluxe experience , proved first night .After long day sightseeing area around Palau Nacional I wanted enjoy glass wine Lobby bar heading dinner town .Regretfully , private event going time gentleman front desk apologized offered served upstairs library-quite area I happily accepted .Shortly finding place sit I could write postcards waiter appeared take order .When returned informed glass wine \u9225\u6e19n house , \u9225 ? , could made happier .Very unexpected , nice .Skeptics might say small gesture like worth extra Euro 110/night choice accommodation , makes difference .I eventually make way lobby bar midnight I enjoyed glass Cava , finger foods , deserts .The later pricey side I expected pay fine hotel .Although I would stay 1898 , I budget constraint I would choose CF hands .You pay , get much .This second trip BCN TripAdvisor members warned area become lot touristy 1997 , I didn\u9225\u6a9b really find case .Still , L\u9225\u6a62ixample far away Placa Catalunya Pasaig de Gracia really nice stroll along \u9225 ? , leisurely otherwise .There reason stay Las Ramblas .Even walker , Diagonal Metro station two stops form Ramblas .A note caution travel car taxi At 11 AM Monday morning took 30 minutes travel Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas CF .I could walked CF half time I didn\u9225\u6a9b large suitcase .I would also like try Hotel Majestic , 2 3 blocks CF many Trip Advisor members spoken highly .But I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b think twice staying CF .I fault experience \u9225 ? , well maybe 5 pound room key system REALLY need done away favor keycard \u9225 ? , otherwise truly wonderful .I never made breakfastas I saved checkout day ended check 4:30 AM due last minute change travel plans .The reviews TA little bit misleading CF .I noticed lot people gave CF 4-out-of-5 nearly reviews 1998 5-out-of-5 .These reviews , coupled uber-cheap rate I originally given CF , made originally want avoid .Too often I stayed \u9225\u6e08reat\u9225 ? , hotel steep discount regretted .I seriously afraid CF past prime .Thankfully CF everything I expected \u9225 ? , actually better b/c surpassed 1898 \u9225 ? , truly tough act follow \u9225 ? , many ways .But I would explain stellar reviews 1898 gets saying probably exceeds people\u9225\u6a9a expectations 4 star hotel sounds like CF sometimes live people\u9225\u6a9a expectations .I would say CF met expectations every way exceeded certain ways well .The 1898 may better value much , much affordably priced offering many similar amenities services .But really comparison .These hotels different vibe \u9225 ? , CF decidedly up-market .Of course tourists hotels Americans dollar used .I believe people judging \u9225\u6e02ang buck\u9225 ? \u9225 ? , Euro 300 worth closer $ 450 little $ 240 ..whopping 87 % increase 6 years .That small consideration .The CF amongst best Barcelona .I hope eventually stay Majestic may find Hotel Arts point , I visited lunch one day felt like I Battery Park City , NYC \u9225 ? , totally cut rest city .And what\u9225\u6a9a lack restaurant high floor ? , How could forget utilize best amenity , charge dearly stellar views , It must reserved hotel guests less one nights stay cost admission probably one spectacular vistas Mediterranean .And probably want avoid afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225 ? , I blame .In meantime , Casa Fuster best place sty Barcelona .Hopefully wont take 10 years go back BCN like time ..

111 Awful - n't stay , Two things firstly , Fisherman 's Wharf really bad location stay , San Francisco - none best restaurants immediate area , Fisherman 's Wharf tacky tourist trap even San Fran residents embarassed .Secondly , must stay , Holiday Inn dire avoided .On arrival , given room beach block 5 minute walk reception nowhere near waterfront .The room already occupied someone 's clothes sill room .On second attempt , room given dark , gloomy , little shabby overlooked carpark - albeit large TV clean bathroom .The swimming pool small next main road - worth booking hotel perk .When checked , took twenty minute wait reception staff clearly overworked underpaid .Food main eating place Holiday Inn Denny 's - real crime eat chain many excellent one-off places throughout city e .g .Mama 's near Washington Square brunch , Tomasso 's North Beach dinner .There nothing depressing walking past load overweight people shovelling processed meat mouths every morning .I guess could n't bothered walk better places , none immediate area .In terms location , Holiday Inn convenient boats Alcatraz - 's .You better staying Nob Hill/Russian Hill area much closer good restaurants , Haight , Castro , Union Square , Golden Gate Park , Ferry Building etc .We also stayed Carlton Hotel vacation , excellent value - nicely decorated room , friendly efficient staff , convenient location - importantly - Denny 's .

119 3rd Visit 18 months , Yes , bathrooms smell - though I think 's less due lack cleanliness due lack ventilation - yes 's bit noise uncarpeted hallways streets outside , location unparalleled , price unbeatable .While n't get amenities like room service laundry , get helpful staff bottled water drink .And , much money , suites huge nicer bathrooms - though buildings separate main hotel .I 'll go back 4th trip .The thing I 'd change would giving set earplugs room - brought makes differnce world ..

128 A romantic weekend Amsterdam , Extremely basic , Asked room near reception get flight extremely steep stairs .No offer help bags staff member busy chatting MSN concentrate booking us .Vending machines reception , empty n't work , Half light bulbs n't work , windows would n't shut .Laminate floorboards kept moving .Strange looking brown bugs everywhere room .Food disgusting , We persuaded eat restaurant downstairs first night , tasteless colourless small extortionately expensive portions .Then go breakfast 's experience , A table laid ham cheese , stale bread rolls large bowl cereals .Cooked breakfast available extra .Tea coffee available , offered , seek .Staff surly , refuse serve , waiter click fingers let know tea ready .To top , came rash assumed allergic reaction something , started wrists spread bodies .Imagine mortified consulted doctor discover SCABIES , The doctor said could caught dirty beds bedding .Under circumstances would recommend hotel anybody .This said , Amsterdam beautiful romantic city n't detract enjoyment derived stay ..
129 Save money , We got back past weekend first time I never happy home vacation .The beach vendors spoke better english hotel employees .The two semesters Spanish I took college got far .Had boyfriend multi-lingual would real problem .When asked iron , told broken .One pipes broke whole outside bloque smelled like raw sewage days .I lost count many times without water night left , hot water shut middle shower .The bufftet average .The meat looked little suspicious rest ok .The service absolutely awful .I live NY gone upscale restaurants well holes wall never seen poor service .Most wait-staff pleasant , I assumed I could understand saying .I think understaffed best .The pools beach beautiful , grounds well maintained , lovely look someplace I would ever return ..
130 Nice hotel We stayed Langham , Place 3 nights weekend pleased chose hotel .All staff friendly happy assist way could .The room modern clean fantastic powerfull shower , however found room small side expected larger one \u9227 ? ,10 p/n incl breakfast paid .We dined Ming Court first night great meal , surprised reasonable food cost I recieved bill .The Shopping Mall next door good selection shops , cafes restaurants go hotel via enclosed walkway .We found best shopping Causeway Bay .If dont want use subway station hotel Taxi hotel cost HK $ 80 incl tip one way .We use hotel spa pool looked great I went look around .The Bar busy good live music happy hour evening 18:30 20:30 drinks 2 1 .Free Internet 6 Laptops available location near bar large Flatscreen TV keep speed World News Sport .The problem stay coming back room late afternoon find room cleaned .Each morning left room 09:30 pressed button request room cleaned dissapointing find room cleaned return .I mentioned checkout even filled form I hope problem sorted .We great time Langham Place would stay I next visit Hong Kong ..
131 They 've raised bar , We originally Toronto decided stay entertainment district weekend fun .We chose hotel added full kitchen , family , 's ideal .We chose studio room got one 14th floor fabulous view CN Tower .Well , Marriott chain outdone Residence Inn location .I believe newly built room spotless showing wear yet .Although hot breakfast buffet pretty standard fare ca n't complain - complimentary breakfast better none .Everything room amazing upgraded lighting fixtures , super-comfy bed high thread count sheets , granite something like granite counters kitchen bath , upgraded work desk table , large bathroom , flat panel TV swivels almost 360 degrees , easy control room temperature settings , nice kitchen appliances kitchenware cheap stuff .Super comfortable - truly home away home .We 're used less stellar service Torontonians service industry , staff friendly , well trained , efficient .A total surprise us , Maybe Toronto changing ways .The complaint thin door huge gap bottom door makes hallway noise seem like 's coming room .I usually save 5 star ratings high end hotels one deserves , Other notes:1 stay away buffet breakfast 9-10am , 's like zoo get crowded2 complimentary wi-fi service good slow times3 parking $ 30/night valet service fast friendly .
132 US travelers beware Potentially Good , Hotel , US travelers - beware ,1 The majority staff n't speak English , 'll end getting wrong drinks bars wrong food la carte restaurants .Drinks BAD anyway- either missing alcohol wrong ingredients altogether .Suggestion - order straight rum , 'll get flavor .2 Do n't bother making reservations Japanese French restaurants .Their food SUCKS .But Steakhouse worth trying , However , buffet Orchidea ? , BEST .3 Also , plan use included non-motorized water sports , 'll wait boat 2-3 days deal rude arrogant staff Scuba Caribe contractors Bahia .When complained resort , Guest Services unable remediate situation .I guess , new , n't realise positive feedback rare commodity .4 Room service great , leave tips beggining trip good sign laguage .On note , fetch beach towels room want take shower .The bathroom designed way gets flooded take shower shower curtains , 'll somehow need contain water till morining , cleaning lady comes ...Summary - Beaches Sandals still best among Carribean all-inclusives .And Bahia mostly oriented Europeans min .25 days vacation throughout year , afford hotel 's screw-ups ..

161 A top choice Barcelona , I spent two nights Casa Fuster 26-28 November .I spent two nights Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas checking CF , although night Standard room CF 110 Euro night expensive Superior room 1898 , CF truly different class 1898 worth extra money .I say however local travel agent quoted rate Euro 240/night inclusive breakfast CF weekend November 17th , I ended change travel dates due work .For days I traveled \u9225 ? , even though I stay CF weekend \u9225 ? , much expensive \u9225 ? , Euro 330/night including breakfast .Obviously , would great get cheaper rate , I would pay higher rate chance stay Casa Fuster service accommodations truly top notch .Let mention I love-hate relationship large hotels .I like hustle bustle crowded lobbies get kind depressed I staying smaller boutique hotels empty-ghost town lobbies .That doesn\u9225\u6a9b mean I fan large numbers tour busses dropping tourists gawk gape wait line afternoon tea .Still , second impression CF 1st absolutely stunning building exterior \u9225 ? , wow , bellhops coming going groups congregating lobby \u9225\u6e18ow real hotel\u9225 ? , I would say CF 1898 similar size , lobby CF much lively 1898 although high occupancy stay .The 1898 somewhat larger lobby however may account seemed sparkly populated .After check I decided walk around town bit .Of course , first thing I noticed I walking back Pasaig de Gracia towards hotel Large grey tour-bus parked outside hotel .Oh well .Guess cant crowded lobby without obligatory tour bus parked outside .Still , lobby crowded way I enjoy I fault Although I expected Standard room CF smaller superior room 1898 , room CF , large , luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent bathroom Hotel de Russie Rome .I think bathroom important part hotel room would gladly give extra room real estate would buy larger bathroom .You could comfortably fit two people bathroom I appreciated even though I traveling alone .In fact entire CF reminded smaller version de Russie .Something decor , layout hallways though I can\u9225\u6a9b put finger .I minor problem shower \u9225 ? , either shower curtain glass panel keep water spilling place , I count figure use , I ended making minor flood bathroom I use towels dry .Thankfully I returned room attendants done turn-down service replaced wet towels fresh ones .Although CF felt start like real deluxe experience , proved first night .After long day sightseeing area around Palau Nacional I wanted enjoy glass wine Lobby bar heading dinner town .Regretfully , private event going time gentleman front desk apologized offered served upstairs library-quite area I happily accepted .Shortly finding place sit I could write postcards waiter appeared take order .When returned informed glass wine \u9225\u6e19n house , \u9225 ? , could made happier .Very unexpected , nice .Skeptics might say small gesture like worth extra Euro 110/night choice accommodation , makes difference .I eventually make way lobby bar midnight I enjoyed glass Cava , finger foods , deserts .The later pricey side I expected pay fine hotel .Although I would stay 1898 , I budget constraint I would choose CF hands .You pay , get much .This second trip BCN TripAdvisor members warned area become lot touristy 1997 , I didn\u9225\u6a9b really find case .Still , L\u9225\u6a62ixample far away Placa Catalunya Pasaig de Gracia really nice stroll along \u9225 ? , leisurely otherwise .There reason stay Las Ramblas .Even walker , Diagonal Metro station two stops form Ramblas .A note caution travel car taxi At 11 AM Monday morning took 30 minutes travel Hotel 1898 Las Ramblas CF .I could walked CF half time I didn\u9225\u6a9b large suitcase .I would also like try Hotel Majestic , 2 3 blocks CF many Trip Advisor members spoken highly .But I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b think twice staying CF .I fault experience \u9225 ? , well maybe 5 pound room key system REALLY need done away favor keycard \u9225 ? , otherwise truly wonderful .I never made breakfastas I saved checkout day ended check 4:30 AM due last minute change travel plans .The reviews TA little bit misleading CF .I noticed lot people gave CF 4-out-of-5 nearly reviews 1998 5-out-of-5 .These reviews , coupled uber-cheap rate I originally given CF , made originally want avoid .Too often I stayed \u9225\u6e08reat\u9225 ? , hotel steep discount regretted .I seriously afraid CF past prime .Thankfully CF everything I expected \u9225 ? , actually better b/c surpassed 1898 \u9225 ? , truly tough act follow \u9225 ? , many ways .But I would explain stellar reviews 1898 gets saying probably exceeds people\u9225\u6a9a expectations 4 star hotel sounds like CF sometimes live people\u9225\u6a9a expectations .I would say CF met expectations every way exceeded certain ways well .The 1898 may better value much , much affordably priced offering many similar amenities services .But really comparison .These hotels different vibe \u9225 ? , CF decidedly up-market .Of course tourists hotels Americans dollar used .I believe people judging \u9225\u6e02ang buck\u9225 ? \u9225 ? , Euro 300 worth closer $ 450 little $ 240 ..whopping 87 % increase 6 years .That small consideration .The CF amongst best Barcelona .I hope eventually stay Majestic may find Hotel Arts point , I visited lunch one day felt like I Battery Park City , NYC \u9225 ? , totally cut rest city .And what\u9225\u6a9a lack restaurant high floor ? , How could forget utilize best amenity , charge dearly stellar views , It must reserved hotel guests less one nights stay cost admission probably one spectacular vistas Mediterranean .And probably want avoid afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225 ? , I blame .In meantime , Casa Fuster best place sty Barcelona .Hopefully wont take 10 years go back BCN like time ..

179 Do Not Recommend Hotel , The room back hotel get natural light outside .The beds sunken impossible sleep .These worst beds seen hotel rating .Concierge presence sporadic reception staff quite helpful .The final bill contained incorrect charges , check bills carefully .The hotel overpriced .We stay even though good location ..
180 Very good hotel great location , My wife I stayed Dia-Ichi Hotel Tokyo last week July 2006 .I would like echo reviewers mentioned , particularly quality hotel great location .The Dai-Ichi Hotel Tokyo across street Shimbashi train station actually underground connection , addition couple subway lines also Yamanote JR train line great getting various sights Yamanote line circle line runs around central Tokyo covered JR rail pass .This means coming Narita airport take Narita Express Tokyo Station get Yamanote line travel two stops Shimbashi .In addition great transportation , also numerous restaurants coffee shops surrounding streets , including full supermarket Shimbashi station .As also mentioned , hotel 15 minute walk fish market handy action starts subway begin operation morning .The hotel nice equivalent 4-star business hotel North America well appointed relatively spacious rooms .The staff helpful always seemed least one staff member available time spoke English .We got good price hotel Expedia CAD $ 160/night - price/quality combination would hard pressed match North American hotel .The word caution would directed towards light sleepers hotel next train tracks times noise filter room ..

184 Awful - n't stay , Two things firstly , Fisherman 's Wharf really bad location stay , San Francisco - none best restaurants immediate area , Fisherman 's Wharf tacky tourist trap even San Fran residents embarassed .Secondly , must stay , Holiday Inn dire avoided .On arrival , given room beach block 5 minute walk reception nowhere near waterfront .The room already occupied someone 's clothes sill room .On second attempt , room given dark , gloomy , little shabby overlooked carpark - albeit large TV clean bathroom .The swimming pool small next main road - worth booking hotel perk .When checked , took twenty minute wait reception staff clearly overworked underpaid .Food main eating place Holiday Inn Denny 's - real crime eat chain many excellent one-off places throughout city e .g .Mama 's near Washington Square brunch , Tomasso 's North Beach dinner .There nothing depressing walking past load overweight people shovelling processed meat mouths every morning .I guess could n't bothered walk better places , none immediate area .In terms location , Holiday Inn convenient boats Alcatraz - 's .You better staying Nob Hill/Russian Hill area much closer good restaurants , Haight , Castro , Union Square , Golden Gate Park , Ferry Building etc .We also stayed Carlton Hotel vacation , excellent value - nicely decorated room , friendly efficient staff , convenient location - importantly - Denny 's .
